Once it is boiling, add the spinach and cook just for a minute, until it completely wilts. Drain and squeeze out as much water as possible with cheesecloth, a clean kitchen towel, or a wooden spoon. When cool enough to handle, coarsely chop and set aside. \n Heat the olive oil and butter in a large skillet over medium heat, add the leek and scallions and cook for 4 to 5 minutes, until softened. Add the garlic, stir, and cook for a minute, until fragrant. Raise the heat to medium high, wait a minute, and add the sliced mushrooms. Sprinkle in a teaspoon salt and black pepper, let them brown for a minute or two, and continue to cook until they let out their juices and begin to brown again, 4 to 5 minutes more. Once their juices have almost evaporated, add the chopped spinach, mix well, and continue cooking for another 4 to 5 minutes, until all the spinach juices evaporate. Turn off the heat, set aside, and let cool to room temperature. \n In a small bowl, beat the eggs, add the requeson or ricotta cheese, the remaining teaspoon salt, and mix well. Combine with the spinach and mushroom mixture and set aside. \n \n To make the zucchini, poblano and corn filling: ​ \n \n Heat 2 tablespoons of olive oil in a large nonstick skillet set over medium-high heat and season the zucchini slices with about ½ teaspoon salt and pepper to taste. Once the oil is hot, working in batches, brown the zucchini slices for a minute or so per side and transfer to a platter covered with paper towels. Set aside when you are done. \n Reduce the heat to medium, add 2 more tablespoons of olive oil and the butter. Once the butter has melted, stir in the onions. Cook, stirring occasionally and scraping the bottom of the pan, for 7 to 8 minutes, until they have completely wilted and have browned around the edges. Add the poblano pepper strips and 1 teaspoon salt, stir, and continue to cook for another couple minutes. Make room in the middle of the pan, add the corn kernels and cook for a couple minutes, stirring to combine with the rest of the mix. Remove from the heat and taste for salt, adding more if need be. Set aside. \n \n To make the salsa roja: ​ \n \n Place the tomatoes, garlic and chiles in a medium saucepan, cover with water and bring to a boil over medium-high heat. Reduce heat to medium and simmer for about 10 minutes, until the tomatoes are cooked and mushy. Place the tomatoes, garlic and chiles into a blender, along with the onion and salt and process until completely smooth. \n Heat the oil in medium saucepan set over medium heat. Once the oil is hot, pour in the pureed tomato mixture, cover partially with a lid and simmer for 5 minutes, stirring here and there. Add the tomato paste and mix well. Pour in the chicken broth, stir, and cook for another 5 minutes, until well seasoned and thickened. Set aside. \n \n To assemble the lasagna:  ​ \n \n Generously butter a 9”x13” baking dish. Bring salted water to a boil in a large pot. Cook the lasagna noodles per package instructions, or for 8 to 9 minutes, stirring them as they cook so they won’t stick. Drain and immediately lay them out them on an oiled baking sheet. \n Set a rack in the middle of the oven and preheat to 375 degrees Fahrenheit. \n Spread about 1/2 cup tomato sauce onto the bottom of the buttered baking dish. Place a layer of cooked lasagna noodles over the sauce, draping them so they coat the entire surface. Spread half the spinach and mushroom filling over the noodles. \n Place a second layer of cooked lasagna noodles. Top with half of the poblano and corn mixture and half of the zucchini slices. Cover with about a cup of the salsa roja. \n Place a third layer of cooked lasagna noodles. Top with the other half of the spinach and mushroom filling. \n Place a fourth layer of cooked lasagna noodles. Add the remaining half of the poblano and corn mixture, the rest of the zucchini slices, and about a cup of the salsa roja. \n Place fifth layer of cooked lasagna noodles and cover with the remaining cup of tomato sauce. Add the grated Oaxaca or mozzarella cheese, and top with the Cotija cheese or parmesano reggiano. \n Cover the baking dish loosely with aluminum foil, making sure it is tight all around the edges, but that there is a lot of space over the cheese - like a tent or bubble - so the aluminum is not very close to the cheese on top. \n Place baking dish on a baking sheet and put into the oven. Bake for 40 minutes, then carefully remove the aluminum foil and return to the oven for another 25 to 30 minutes. The top should have melted, browned and begun to crisp along the edges. Remove from the oven and let the lasagna sit for 10 minutes before cutting into it. \n Edit this page","hierarchy":{"lvl0":"Veggie Loaded Mexican Lasagna","lvl1":null,"lvl2":null,"lvl3":null,"lvl4":null,"lvl5":null,"lvl6":null},"objectID":"faa4f8d325794610454bc0246ee5110c6bda92c1","type":"content","url":"https://danroscigno.github.io/Recipes/Veggie_Loaded_Mexican_Lasagna/","url_without_anchor":"https://danroscigno.github.io/Recipes/Veggie_Loaded_Mexican_Lasagna/"}

Add the minced garlic and cook until fragrant and cooked through. Add the sugar, red wine vinegar, rice wine vinegar, red pepper powder, Creole seasoning, black pepper, salt and 1 cup water and cook until the flavors to meld and develop, about 10 minutes. Add the collard greens in batches if necessary, waiting a few minutes for the collard greens to begin to break down in the pot likker (the liquid in the pot) before adding the rest. Allow to cook over low to medium heat until you achieve the desired texture and the greens have an agreeable amount of salt, spice and acid, 2 to 3 hours. Let the collards cool in their pot likker and reserve until ready to prepare your sandwich. (This can be done a day or more ahead of time.) \n For the coleslaw:  Add the cabbage, mayonnaise, onion, vinegar, pepper and some salt to a large mixing bowl. Wearing gloves, mix with your hands, massaging the cabbage to break it down in the mayonnaise. (It should yield less than a quarter of the original volume when it&#x27;s all said and done.) Taste to make sure you have enough salt and vinegar. Reserve in the refrigerator, as it tastes best on the sandwich as a cold component. (This can be done up to a day ahead of time.) \n For the pickled cherry pepper Russian dressing:  Mix up the mayonnaise, cherry peppers, ketchup, red pepper powder, hot sauce, paprika, black pepper and some salt in a bowl. \n For the sandwich:  Brush some butter on both sides of each slice of rye bread and toast on both sides on a nonstick griddle or in a large nonstick saute pan. On two slices of bread, place a slice of Swiss cheese and allow to melt fully (covering the pan or putting a dome over the bread on the flattop will facilitate the melting process). \n Meanwhile, heat some greens in a saute pan. Place a handful of coleslaw on a cheesy slice of rye bread. Place the other cheesy slice of rye on top of that. Spoon your collard greens on top of that slice, being careful not to bring too much of the pot likker with them as this will make for a soggy end product. Dress the third slice of rye with a liberal slather of the Russian dressing and place it face-down on top of the collards. Cut it in half and serve. \n Edit this page","hierarchy":{"lvl0":"Collard Greens Melt (Vegetarian Rueben)","lvl1":null,"lvl2":null,"lvl3":null,"lvl4":null,"lvl5":null,"lvl6":null},"objectID":"f28e6100877f98d2ed537fef28e59ff1d94947b1","type":"content","url":"https://danroscigno.github.io/Recipes/Collard_Greens_Melt_or_Vegetarian_Rueben/","url_without_anchor":"https://danroscigno.github.io/Recipes/Collard_Greens_Melt_or_Vegetarian_Rueben/"}

(Don’t rinse.) \n Preheat the oven to 375F� � \n **Pan Sear:**In a large  dutch oven , or ovenproof skillet, over medium-high heat, heat 2 tablespoons oil. Working in 2 batches, brown two sides of the eggplant, until golden, then set these aside. No need to cook through. \n **Make the stew:**Add more oil to the same pan, and the onion and saute 2-3 minutes, stirring.

Add the spices, canned tomatoes (and juices),  raisins,  salt , pepper, chickpeas and  veggie broth . Bring to simmer, stirring. \n Nestle in the eggplant and give the pan a good shake so the stew levels. It should be like a stew-like. If it seems dry, add a little water. Drizzle with a little  olive oil , cover tightly and place in the warm oven. \n Bake 20-25 minutes or until eggplant is tender and cooked through. While it’s baking make the couscous. \n Remove the lid, taste adding more  salt to taste, keeping in mind the couscous will soak up some of the  salt . If you feel the stew needs more flavor overall, add a little more  ras el hanout , a 1/2 teaspoon at a time, tasting as you go. If it seems watery, bake uncovered for a few minutes. If dry, add a little water. To serve, Sprinkle with optional   Aleppo chili flakes and fresh Parsley.

{"anchor":null,"content":"Gluten-free Ebelskivers Gluten-free Ebelskivers \n Breakfasts   Gluten Free \n Makes 18-24 \n Ingredients: \n \n 1 cup gluten-free flour blend (be sure it includes xantham gum) \n 1.5 tsps sugar \n 1/2 tsp baking powder \n 1/4 tsp salt \n 2 large eggs, separated \n 1 cup whole milk \n 2 TBSPs unsalted butter, melted... plus extra for greasing your ebelskiver pan \n your favorite jam, laughing cow cheese, deli ham for filling of your choice \n \n Directions: \n Melt butter gently in your microwave or on the stovetop. Set aside to cool. While butter cools, separate the eggs. Place yolks in a medium-sized bowl and whites in a small pitcher or bowl where you can whip them. Using a hand-held mixer or your strong arm, whip the egg whites until wet peaks begin to form. Set egg whites aside. \n In a large bowl, whisk together flour, sugar, baking powder & salt. Add milk and melted butter to the egg yolks and whisk until combined. Add wet ingredients to dry ingredients and blend completely. \n Before we add the whipped egg whites to the batter, set the ebelskiver pan on the stovetop over medium heat. Brush each ebelskiver well with a bit of melted butter. As the butter heats up, gently fold whipped egg whites into the batter in two additions. Fold delicately until no visible egg whites remain.  \n It&#x27;s time to add the batter to the pan once the butter begins to bubble within the ebelskiver wells. For plain ebelskivers, add approximately 3 TBSPs of batter to each well. If you&#x27;re making jam-filled ebelskivers, drop about 1 TBSP of batter into each well followed by 1 tsp of your favorite jam and top with another 1 TBSP of batter. If you&#x27;re making ham & cheese filled ebelskivers, drop about 1 TBSP batter into each well followed by ham & cheese to your taste and top with another 1 TBSP of batter. \n Quick tip-- fill your ebelskiver wells in the same order every time. Start at the top, work your way around clock-wise, ending with the middle well. This will help each ebelskiver cook evenly... they&#x27;ll all be in the pan for the same amount of time. \n After 3-5 minutes, use your  ebelskiver tongs , chopsticks or even little forks to flip each ebelskiver in the pan. Cook approximately 3 minutes more, so that both sides of the ebelskiver cook until lightly browned.  \n Flip the fully-cooked ebelskivers out onto a plate and eat immediately or keep warm in a 200 degree oven. I think it&#x27;s best to eat them right away... they will deflate a little bit the longer they sit in the oven.  Edit this page","hierarchy":{"lvl0":"Gluten-free Ebelskivers","lvl1":null,"lvl2":null,"lvl3":null,"lvl4":null,"lvl5":null,"lvl6":null},"objectID":"e93b91b9a2d6ee22e3ac73d61ea5a44afa268387","type":"content","url":"https://danroscigno.github.io/Recipes/Gluten-free_Ebelskivers/","url_without_anchor":"https://danroscigno.github.io/Recipes/Gluten-free_Ebelskivers/"}

Pound until even thickness, but not so thin it starts breaking apart. Around 3/4&quot; is fine. Cut and discard any parts around the breast that rip off (can cut the tails off to create circle/burger shape if you want). Repeat with remaining breasts. \n Marinate: In a large mixing bowl combine buttermilk, hot sauce, salt and white pepper. Add in the chicken breasts and combine to ensure they&#x27;ll all coated. Cover with cling film and marinate in the fridge. I recommend a minimum of 4 hours (up to overnight) but just as long as you have time for. Take the chicken out the fridge 30mins before needed to bring close to room temp_ (see notes)._ \n Dredge: In a large shallow dish or tray combine flour with paprika, cayenne pepper, onion & garlic powder, baking powder and salt & black pepper. One by one coat the breasts in the flour, making sure you completely coat each time. Really get in all the cracks and crevices of the chicken to create lots of little flaky parts. Place to one side. \n Fry: In a large pot or deep pan heat up oil to 180C/356F. In batches of 1-2 (depending on pot size), carefully lower the chicken in the hot oil. The temp will likely drop to around 165C/300F, just maintain that heat as the chicken fries. Depending on the thickness of the chicken it&#x27;ll take around 4-5mins on one side, then flip and continue frying for another couple of minutes. The chicken should be deep golden, visibly crunchy with the bubbling oil starting to slow down. The internal temp of the chicken should reach 75C/165F. Carefully remove and rest on wire rack with paper towels underneath (don&#x27;t place directly on paper towel or they&#x27;ll lose crispiness). Bring oil temp back up to 180C/356F between each batch. \n Glaze: Once you&#x27;ve fried the 4 breasts, scoop out 1/2cup of the oil and pour into a mixing bowl. Add in honey, hot sauce, smoked paprika, garlic powder, salt & black pepper and whisk until it emulsifies and thickens into a glaze. Brush both sides of the chicken with the glaze. \n Sandwich: Stack the sandwich in the following order - toasted bun, mayonnaise, lettuce, chicken, pickles & jalapeños, top bun.

{"anchor":null,"content":"Braised Winter Squash Wedges Braised Winter Squash Wedges \n Want to make   Side dish   Kim Acceptable \n Serves 4 \n 2-1/4 to 2-1/2 pounds (1 to 1.15 kilograms) winter squash (about 1/2 kabocha or red kuri squash) \n 2 tablespoons (30 grams)unsalted butter \n 2 tablespoons (25 grams) olive oil, divided \n Leaves from 6 sprigs fresh thyme \n Kosher salt and freshly ground black pepper \n 6 garlic cloves, smashed \n 1 cup (235 grams) vegetable broth \n 14/ cup (60 grams) apple-cider vinegar \n 1 cup (230 grams) plain Greek-style yogurt \n 2 cups (55 grams) baby arugula leaves \n Note: If you can find it—you can often buy squash in halves \n or quarters from a farmers&#x27; market, which is great, because \n it runs large—kabocha is my favorite here, followed by red \n kuri squash. Butternut and acorn squash work, too. The peel of \n winter squash is fully edible, so no need to trim it away. \n This is my favorite way to cook winter squash. It takes a cue from \n Tfondant, or melting, potatoes, a technique in which thick slices of \n potato are roasted on both sides before they finish cooking braised in a \n puddle of broth. From the oven, they&#x27;re crisp and somewhat glazed out- \n side, creamy inside, and booming with more flavor than it seems possible \n to lock inside a potato. Clearly, I&#x27;m a fan—but I had no idea that when I \n applied this technique to big wedges of winter squash I&#x27;d never want to \n cook it another way again. \n I add to the pan everything I like with winter squash—thyme, garlic, \n and cider vinegar, which gets sweet/tangy when cooked and really helps \n cut through the sweetness of squash —and then I put the whole thing on a \n plate of tart yogurt and peppery baby arugula. Any slightly syrupy broth \n left in the pan is poured over everything, and it&#x27;s all so good together, you \n might wonder why you&#x27;d ever consider squash a side dish again. This is \n centerpiece squash, and it wants you to know it. \n Heat the oven to 425°F (220°C). \n Cut the squash in half and scoop out the seeds and pulp, then slice \n the halves into 1-1/2-inch wedges. Add butter and 1 tablespoon of the oil \n to a 10-by-15-inch baking sheet, and place in the oven until the butter \n melts, about 2 minutes. Remove the tray from the oven, and roll the but- \n ter around so that it evenly coats the pan. Arrange the squash wedges in \n one layer, and sprinkle with thyme, 1/2 teaspoon salt, and lots of freshly \n ground black pepper. Roast for 15 minutes, or until deeply browned under- \n neath. Flip the slices, and season the second side on top with another \n 1/2 teaspoon salt and more pepper. Scatter the garlic cloves in the pan, \n and return the pan to the oven to roast for another 12 to 15 minutes, until \n the wedges are browned on the second side. Don&#x27;t worry if the squash \n isn&#x27;t fully cooked yet. Carefully pour the broth and vinegar into the pan, \n and roast for another 10 to 15 minutes, until the squash is tender and the \n liquid is somewhat cooked off \n To serve the squash: Use the back of a spoon to swirl plain yogurt onto a serving platter into a thin layer. Toss the arugula with the remaining tablespoon olive oil and a pinch of salt and pepper, and scatter over the yogurt. Arrange the squash wedges on top, scrape out every bit of pan juice that&#x27;s left, and pour it over the squash.

If you don&#x27;t have a springform pan, use a 9-inch cake pan instead. Line the bottom of the pan with a 9-inch parchment baking round. Lightly grease the parchment paper. Place the pan on a baking sheet. \n Whisk the flour, cinnamon, salt, and baking powder together in a small bowl; set aside. \n Cut the plum halves in half again and toss them in a medium bowl with the tapioca/cornstarch, brandy (see note below), and ¾ cup of the sugar; set aside for 15 minutes. \n Meanwhile, make the dough.  Beat the butter and remaining sugar together until light and fluffy, about 1 minute at medium-high speed. With the mixer on low, gradually add the dry ingredients and stir just until it starts to come together. Add 1 tablespoon of the water and stir the mixture for about 30 seconds, until it becomes crumbly and just holds together when lightly squeezed. If the mixture still seems a little dry at this point, stir in another tablespoon of water. \n Reserve about 1 cup of the dough on the side and press the remaining dough into the bottom of the prepared pan in an even layer and working the dough about 1 inch up the sides of the pan. Pour the fruit mixture evenly over the dough (or neatly arrange the plums in concentric circles if you want the tart a little less &quot;rustic&quot;). Crumble the remaining dough over the top of the fruit. \n Bake for 55 - 65 minutes, until the fruit is bubbly and the crust is golden brown.

{"anchor":null,"content":"World Championship Baby Back Ribs World Championship Baby Back Ribs \n Main Meal   American \n Servings 6-12 \n Ingredients: \n Basic BBQ Rub: \n 1 cup turbinado sugar \n 1/2 cup granulated sugar  \n 1/2 cup kosher salt  \n 1 tablespoon onion powder  \n 2 tablespoons granulated garlic  \n 1 1/2 teaspoons cayenne pepper  \n 1 teaspoon finely ground black pepper \n 2 teaspoons ground mustard  \n 4 tablespoons chili powder  \n 1 teaspoon ground cumin  \n 6 tablespoons Spanish paprika  \n BBQ Mother Sauce: \n 1/4 cup canola oil \n 3/4 cup finely diced sweet or yellow onion  \n 2 tablespoons minced garlic  \n 1 1/2 cups ketchup  \n 1/2 cup honey  \n 2 tablespoons tomato paste  \n 1/4 cup white vinegar  \n 1/4 cup plus 2 tablespoons packed dark brown sugar  \n 1/4 cup Worcestershire sauce  \n 2 teaspoons dry mustard  \n 1 teaspoon cayenne  \n 1 teaspoon freshly ground black pepper  \n Ribs: \n 6 slabs baby back ribs, about 3 pounds each \n 1 cup plus 2 tablespoons yellow mustard  \n 6 tablespoons honey  \n 1 cup turbinado sugar  \n 1 cup purple grape juice  \n 1 teaspoon dry chipotle powder  \n Directions: \n \n For the basic BBQ rub: Using a coffee grinder, grind the turbinado sugar with a few &quot;pulses&quot; until it is lightly powdered. Combine with the granulated sugar, salt, onion powder, granulated garlic, cayenne, black pepper, mustard, chili powder, cumin and paprika in a bowl and hand stir until well incorporated. Store in an airtight container. \n For the BBQ mother sauce: In a medium saucepan, heat the oil over medium heat. Add the onion and saute until translucent, about 5 minutes. Turn the heat to low if the onion is cooking too fast--you don&#x27;t want it caramelized or browned. As the onion is getting close, add the garlic and cook until lightly golden, about 2 minutes longer. Add the ketchup, honey, tomato paste, vinegar, brown sugar, Worcestershire, dry mustard, cayenne and black pepper and stir well. Slowly add up to 1/2 cup water until the sauce reaches the consistency you like. A slightly thick consistency is best. Add about 3 tablespoons of the basic BBQ rub, stir well and taste. The sauce should have a good, well-rounded flavor. Add more of the basic BBQ rub in 1-tablespoon increments until your desired flavor is achieved, up to about 1/2 cup total. Cool and store in an airtight container in the refrigerator for up to 10 days. \n For the ribs: Rinse the ribs and remove the membrane from the back. Trim any excess fat from the tops of the slabs. Trim 1 bone from the large end of the ribs and 2 bones from the small end. This will give you a much more consistent slab for cooking. \n Starting on the backs, sprinkle the slabs of ribs with approximately 1/2 tablespoon of the basic BBQ rub each, then add 1/2 tablespoon yellow mustard each and massage into the meat. Flip the ribs over and repeat. Wrap tightly with plastic wrap and refrigerate for at least 8 hours. For a contest, I marinate ribs like this for 12 to 16 hours. \n Prepare a smoker to run at 225 degrees F with around 4 chunks of apple wood and 4 chunks of cherry wood so that the wood will smolder throughout the cooking. Remove the ribs from the refrigerator, unwrap and repeat the basic BBQ rub and mustard procedure, massaging them in. Don&#x27;t get it too thick or paste-like, as this will give you a dark appearance when cooked. Place the ribs in the smoker meat-side up and cook for 2 hours. Remove the ribs from the smoker and increase the temperature to 250 degrees F. Apply the basic BBQ rub and mustard to both sides of the ribs as before. On the top sides, slather approximately 1 tablespoon of honey over the surface of each slab, then sprinkle heavily with the turbinado sugar. Lay each slab of ribs meat-side up on a piece of heavy-duty aluminum foil and fold up the edges. Pour approximately 1 to 2 ounces of the grape juice into the bottom of each foil package, then finish wrapping the ribs but don&#x27;t crimp the edges--you want steam to be able to escape. \n Return the ribs to the cooker for 2 hours, then test for tenderness. (I cook ribs in this stage until they look overdone and too tender. Don&#x27;t worry, they&#x27;ll tighten up. If they still have too much texture, leave them in for 20 to 30 more minutes.) Remove the ribs from the cooker, open the foil and drain off the liquid. Using the foil as a tool, &quot;roll&quot; the ribs over so the bone side is up, glaze with the BBQ mother sauce, then roll them back over and glaze the tops. Using long tongs, carefully remove the ribs from the foil and place them back in the smoker for 15 minutes. This will let the glaze cook onto the ribs and let the ribs tighten back up. Remove from the cooker and allow to rest for 5 minutes, apply a very thin coat of sauce to &quot;glisten&quot; the ribs, then lightly sprinkle with chipotle powder before serving. \n Edit this page","hierarchy":{"lvl0":"World Championship Baby Back Ribs","lvl1":null,"lvl2":null,"lvl3":null,"lvl4":null,"lvl5":null,"lvl6":null},"objectID":"ceb9b3fc672c4950d36d752ce8d29b73b669925f","type":"content","url":"https://danroscigno.github.io/Recipes/World_Championship_Baby_Back_Ribs/","url_without_anchor":"https://danroscigno.github.io/Recipes/World_Championship_Baby_Back_Ribs/"}

{"anchor":null,"content":"Orange Rolls Orange Rolls \n Breads \n Yield: 8 rolls \n INGREDIENTS: \n For the Dough: \n \n 1⅔ cups all-purpose flour, plus more for rolling \n 1¾ tsp baking powder \n ¼ tsp fine salt \n 3 Tbsps cold unsalted butter, cut into small pieces, plus softened butter for the pan \n 2 Tbsp cold cream cheese \n ⅔ cup whole milk or half-and-half \n \n For the Filling: \n \n ⅓ cup packed light brown sugar \n 1 orange, zested \n ½ tsp ground cinnamon or a combination of cinnamon and cardamom \n 2 Tbsps unsalted butter, very soft \n \n For the Glaze: \n \n ¼ cup cream cheese, room temperature \n 3 Tbsp confectioners’ sugar, or to taste \n 1 orange \n \n PREPARATION: \n \n Make the dough: Heat the oven to 375 degrees. Place the brown sugar in a small bowl and zest the orange directly over it. Gently rub the zest into the sugar and transfer 2 tablespoons/25 grams to a large bowl to use for the dough. Save the rest of the orange sugar for the filling.\n Step 1 \n Add the flour, baking powder and salt to the large bowl and whisk well. Add the butter and cream cheese, and smash and rub them into the dry ingredients with your fingertips until they’re fully incorporated and the mixture resembles crumbs.\n Step 2 \n Add the milk all at once and stir gently with a fork until the dough comes together and no dry bits remain. Freeze while you prepare the pan and filling. Very generously butter the bottom and sides of an 8-inch round cake pan or ovenproof skillet.\n Step 3 \n Make the filling: Mix the cinnamon (and cardamom, if using) into the reserved orange sugar.\n Step 4 \n Scrape the dough onto a well-floured work surface. Use a floured rolling pin to roll the dough or flour your hands to pat the dough into a 12-by-5-inch rectangle. It may be sticky, but that’s OK. Just flour the dough enough to be able to shape it.\n Step 5 \n To fill the dough, spread the very soft butter evenly over the surface, then sprinkle the orange sugar on top. Starting with one long side of the dough, roll it up into a 12-inch-long log. If it’s stuck to the surface, scrape it up as you roll it using a bench scraper or stiff spatula.\n Step 6 \n Use a serrated knife to cut the log with a sawing motion into 8 (1½-inch-thick) slices. Place a slice in the center of the pan, then space the remaining slices ½-inch apart around it. At this point, the rolls can be covered and chilled for up to 2 days before baking directly from the refrigerator.\n Step 7 \n Bake until golden on top, 23 to 25 minutes. You don’t want to overbake, but also want the dough to be cooked through. When you press the top, the roll shouldn’t sink but spring back just a little.\n Step 8 \n If you’d like to glaze the rolls, make the glaze while the rolls bake: Place the cream cheese then the confectioners’ sugar in a bowl. Zest the orange directly over the sugar, then mix and smush together until smooth. Squeeze in 2 tablespoons orange juice and mix well. The glaze should be a bit thick because it will loosen when it hits the hot rolls. Taste and add more confectioners’ sugar if you’d like. Stir in more juice if it’s too stiff.\n Step 9 \n Let the rolls cool for 5 minutes in the pan, then spread the glaze all over them. Cool a bit longer to serve hot or warm.\n Step 10 \n Edit this page","hierarchy":{"lvl0":"Orange Rolls","lvl1":null,"lvl2":null,"lvl3":null,"lvl4":null,"lvl5":null,"lvl6":null},"objectID":"cea6f622f3a4c14be078edb081bbc45e7f996126","type":"content","url":"https://danroscigno.github.io/Recipes/Orange_Rolls/","url_without_anchor":"https://danroscigno.github.io/Recipes/Orange_Rolls/"}

Cut through the fat down to the rib bones. \n Turn the rack on end, with the bones facing up and push a knife through the flesh between each rib, using the initial cut as a guide for the knife. Cut down the side of each rib to remove the excess fat in between each rib. Using strong kitchen twine, wrap the twine around each rib at the base, nearest the meat and pull to remove all of the remaining fat and sinew from the rib bone. \n Bend each rack into a semicircle (meat side in and fat side out) and using kitchen twine tie them together at the base and center, in order to hold the racks together. The rib ends should be pushed outward to create the look of a crown. \n Rub the lamb with the olive oil. Combine the salt, pepper, garlic, thyme and coriander and press all over the lamb. Place the roast in a Bundt pan with the center of the pan coming up through the middle of the roast. \n Place on the middle rack of the oven and cook for 30 to 35 minutes, until the meat reaches an internal temperature of 130 degrees F. This is approximately 8 to 12 minutes per pound. Remove from the oven, transfer the roast to a rack, cover with aluminum foil and let the meat rest for 20 minutes. While the meat is resting add the sherry vinegar, mustard and rosemary to the juices that accumulated in the Bundt pan while cooking. Stir to combine. Taste and adjust seasoning, as needed.

Set aside. \n Combine the sugar and the lemon and orange zest in a small bowl and rub the zests into the sugar with your fingers to infuse the sugar. Set aside. \n In a stand mixer fitted with a whisk attachment, beat the softened butter and oil together until they become homogenous, about 3 minutes. This will not work if your butter is not completely room temperature. \n Slowly add the granulated sugar to the oil and butter, beating on high until the mixture is light and fluffy and turns a very pale yellow, about 3 minutes. \n Add the eggs in one at time, scraping down the bowl in between each addition. Add the lemon extract and the vanilla extract.

{"anchor":null,"content":"Banana Peel Cake with Brown Sugar Frosting On this page Banana Peel Cake with Brown Sugar Frosting \n Desserts   Picnic Fare \n From Cooking with Scraps&quot; by Lindsay-Jean Hard  \n Makes one 2 layer 8” cake \n Ingredients: ​ \n For the cake: ​ \n Peels from 2 very ripe bananas, stem and very bottom discarded (see note) \n 1/2 cup unsalted butter, softened, plus more for buttering the pans  \n 1 1/2 cups granulated sugar  \n 2 large eggs, separated  \n 1/2 cup buttermilk  \n 1 2/3 cups cake flour, plus more (any type) for flouring the pans  \n 1 teaspoon baking soda  \n 1/4 teaspoon baking powder  \n 1/2 teaspoon fine-grain sea salt  \n For the frosting: ​ \n 1/2 cup unsalted butter \n 1 cup packed light or dark brown sugar  \n 1/4 cup milk, 2 percent or higher  \n 1 3/4 to 2 cups powdered sugar, sifted  \n Directions: ​ \n \n Heat the oven to 350 degrees F. \n To make the cake: Cut the banana peels into 1-inch pieces and place them in a small saucepan with 1 cup of water. Bring to a boil over medium-high heat, then reduce the heat and simmer for 10 minutes. Remove the pan from the heat and allow the mixture to cool slightly, then drain the banana peels, reserving 1/4 cup of the cooking water. \n Meanwhile, butter and flour the sides of two 8-inch round cake pans and line the bottoms with parchment paper. Butter and flour the pans again to coat the paper. \n Transfer the peels and the 1/4 cup of cooking water to a tall, narrow container and puree with an immersion blender until completely smooth (a mini food processor would do the trick, too!). \n Cream together the butter and sugar in a large bowl using an electric mixer (or a wooden spoon for an arm workout) until pale and fluffy, 3 to 5 minutes. Add the egg yolks one at a time, mixing until incorporated, and scraping down the sides of the bowl after each addition. Mix in the banana peel mixture, then stir in the buttermilk until well-combined. \n In a medium-size bowl, whisk together the flour, baking soda, baking powder, and salt. Add the dry ingredients to the bowl with the butter mixture and stir gently, just until combined. \n Put the egg whites in another bowl (make sure it&#x27;s clean and dry!) and whisk until soft peaks form -- either by hand or with the whisk attachment on an electric mixer. If using an electric mixer, start slowly and gradually increase speed to medium-high. You&#x27;re done when you pull out the whisk or beater and a soft peak is formed, but immediately collapses. Gently fold the egg whites into the batter and divide the batter evenly between the two prepared pans. \n Bake, rotating the pans halfway through, until the tops are golden and a toothpick inserted into the center of each cake pulls out with dry crumbs rather than wet batter, about 25 minutes. Let the cakes cool completely in the pans. \n When the cakes are completely cool and you&#x27;re ready to assemble, make the frosting: Melt the butter in a medium saucepan over low heat. Stir in the brown sugar and cook, stirring constantly, for 2 minutes. Stir in the milk, raise the heat to medium-high and cook, stirring constantly until the mixture boils. Remove from the heat and let cool to lukewarm. Gradually whisk in 1 3/4 cups powdered sugar, beating until smooth. Add the additional 1/4 cup powdered sugar if the frosting is too loose. Use the frosting immediately, as it will begin to thicken and stiffen as it sits. \n To remove the cake from the pans, invert one cake pan on a serving plate, lift pan, and peel the parchment. Repeat for the second cake pan. Put one layer of the cake on a serving platter and spread about one-third of the frosting evenly over the top. Set the other layer on top, and spread the remaining frosting over the top and sides of the cake. \n \n *Cook’s Note: ​ \n If you have time to plan ahead, you can skip the step of cooking the banana peels, by freezing and thawing them to soften them. Remove the stem and very bottom of the banana peels, then cut the peels into 1-inch pieces and freeze in an airtight container in the freezer until you&#x27;re ready to bake the cake. Thaw the peels, either in the refrigerator or the counter, depending on your timeline, and puree the peels as directed in step 4, adding up to 1/4 cup of water if needed. The peels will be nearly black, and thus the puree will not be pretty, but the final cake will be just as delicious. Banana peels contain some of the same proteins found in latex, and could cause an allergic reaction. Those same proteins might also make your immersion blender feel slightly gummy to the touch. Rub the surface down with cooking oil, and then wash it normally.

It was so cold and it tasted sooooo good! His communication of the process was not so hot!! ( The regular text is from Stu, while the italicized text are notes from me, to explain what I did!) \n Ingredients: \n Potatoes, quite a lot! ( I used red potatoes ). \n Carrots ( 5-6 large, cut in small chunks ).  \n 2 Tins of beans, use whatever kind you like ( I made 1lb. dried northern beans, precooked in instapot with 6 cups of chicken broth, celery seed, 2 small bay leaves, garlic powder, onion powder, marjoram, and salt & pepper. Cook per instapot and add to other cooked ingredients with the cooking broth, but remove bay leaves ). \n 4 sticks of celery ( chopped into small chunks ). \n Onions,  i like lots of onions ( I used 2 large onions, diced ). \n Brown lentils ( I used one 16 oz bag, cooked with the veggies, then veggie stock or chicken bone broth/stock and seasoning, cooked just enough to soften ). \n 1 tin of peas or frozen if you prefer ( I used one bag of frozen ). \n “You can add any other filling you wish.” \n Worcester sauce, quite a few dashes of this \n Tomato ketchup, maybe 2 tablespoons \n liquid smoke, A couple of capfuls (or more). \n a tablespoon of HP brown sauce ( I used 3 ). \n A veg stock concentrate ( I used 2 Tablespoons ). \n salt and pepper, \n Garlic,  Again i like a lot of garlic, at least a couple of segments. ( I used 4 cloves ). \n Dried thyme, tarragon, marjoram, rosemary, parsley, and bay leaves x 2. \n Beef broth ~5-6 cups ( I used veggie and chicken ) \n 1/2 cup butter \n Milk \n 1 cup cheddar cheese \n Gravy mix \n Stu: “Yeah it’s a complex dish the way i do it lol.” \n First things first, get your potatoes on the boil and and also your lentils if you are using them.  Lentils are best boiling in veg or (chicken) stock.  Salt the potatoes of course but not the lentils.  You need quite a lot of potatoes.  Most times i never make enough and end up making more. \n If you are using  meat you would prepare in the normal fashion by saute onions, then add meat till brown and then other veg and ingredients and saute till beginning to soft then add some veg stock and cook until veg is done. \n if you are using lentils you want to saute the onions first then add all the other veg and fresh garlic and let them all soften up together a bit in a large pot for a bit. \n Then add all the other ingredients and let them cook together for a few minutes before you add small amount of veg stock to cover and to boil till veg cooked.  Dont overcook as its all got to go in the oven. \n once potatoes are ready you want to make your mash.  Im sure you know this but let them steam off before you mash.  Then add your butter and a splash of milk and mash mash mash. . \n Once lentils are done you should not have hardly any liquid left in them as they should absorb it all.  You want drain off rest and let them sit. \n (Now i normally use Bisto, which again, i dont think you will get. So get a gravy mix of some kind and prepare that in separate pot.  Keep it nice and thick though). \n Once everything is all ready mix everything together well in a large pot or bowl including lentils and gravy. season to taste at this point. \n You are now ready to transfer to a large pyrex dish. Add  lentil Mix first then cover with  the delicious mashed potato and top with cheese. \n You can now keep like this for days if you wish before you pop in the oven at 400 for around 30 to 40 minutes or until the cheese is nice and crispy on top.

Cook the poblanos until totally charred all over, turning as needed, about 2 minutes per side. Transfer to a small bowl and cover with plastic wrap so the poblanos can steam. After 10 minutes, use your fingers to pull the blackened skins away from the poblanos, then remove the stems and seeds. Roughly chop the poblanos and set aside.\n Step 2 \n While the poblano chiles steam, place a large skillet over medium heat. Working in batches to cook the guajillo chiles evenly in one layer, flatten the chile halves on the hot skillet and toast them for about 15 seconds, turning once. Put the chiles in a bowl and add 2 cups hot water to help soften them. Set aside.\n Step 3 \n Prepare the meat: Season the meat all over with the salt.

Add the flour and stir with a spoon or your fingers to make a loose, almost liquid, dough. Cover the bowl with plastic wrap and let rise in a warm place for at least 6 hours, or overnight. \n In a small bowl, combine the raisins and grappa or brandy, and let marinate for at least 4 hours, or overnight. \n In a large bowl, stir the butter, eggs, yolks, sugar, warm water and vanilla together. Drain the marinated raisins in a small strainer set over a bowl and press on the raisins with a spoon to extract as much liquid as possible. Set the raisins aside and add the liquid to the egg mixture. Add the sponge and mix well with your hands. Add the flour about 2 cups at a time, mixing with your hands until a ball of dough forms. \n Turn the dough out onto a floured work surface and knead for 5 to 10 minutes, or until smooth and elastic, adding additional flour as needed. \n Butter a large bowl, place the dough in the bowl, and turn to coat. Cover with a clean cloth and let rise for 6 hours in a warm place. \n Butter and flour a panettone or other deep mold at least 6½ inches tall and 7 to 8 inches wide. (The ceramic insert to a crockpot is ideal. Or you can use two 2-pound coffee cans and make 2 smaller loaves. Panettone can also be baked in two greased and floured 6 by 6-inch clay flowerpots.) \n Punch down the dough and turn it out onto a floured surface. Flatten the dough out with your hands and sprinkle on the lemon and orange zest. In a small bowl, mix the raisins and citron with the 1 tablespoon flour, and sprinkle the mixture over the dough. Fold the dough in half, press the edges together, and knead to distribute the fruits. Continue to knead for 5 to 10 minutes or until the dough is smooth, adding additional flour if necessary. Place the dough in the mold, cover with a clean cloth, and let rise for 35 minutes in a warm place. \n Preheat the oven to 400ºF. Cut an X in the top of the bread. Bake for 5 minutes, reduce the heat to 375ºF, and bake for 10 minutes. Reduce the heat to 350ºF, and bake for 30 to 35 minutes longer, or until a skewer inserted in the center of the bread comes out clean. If the top begins to brown too much, cover the bread loosely with a piece of foil. \n Cool the bread on a rack for about 30 minutes before removing it from the mold. \n         Edit this page","hierarchy":{"lvl0":"Panettone","lvl1":null,"lvl2":null,"lvl3":null,"lvl4":null,"lvl5":null,"lvl6":null},"objectID":"9faa0e6832cd2eda1e466f755e171f07f139a7cc","type":"content","url":"https://danroscigno.github.io/Recipes/Panettone/","url_without_anchor":"https://danroscigno.github.io/Recipes/Panettone/"}

Slice each one in half lengthwise. Keep fingers away from the knife to avoid injury. Use a spoon to scoop out the seeds and fleshy strands tangled with the seeds. \n Place butternut squash cut sides up on a baking sheet. Drizzle the cut sides of the butternut squash halves with olive oil and rub the oil into the squash.

Probably not necessary since the sausage is already usually salty (unless you use sweet sausage which I do not recommend). \n \n Assembly: \n \n By this time, you have roasted the butternut squash for 30 or 40 minutes. Remove them from the oven and turn the cooked squash halves cut sides up. \n Let it cool slightly. Using a spoon, scoop out the flesh leaving about a 1-inch border along the sides. (For reference, I provide the step-by-step photos for this step above the recipe card). \n Reheat the sausage mixture in the same skillet in which you made it to warm it up. \n Divide the sausage filling among the 4 halves and stuff the squash until the mixture is leveled or a little bit higher. \n Top with freshly ground black pepper and fresh thyme. \n Edit this page","hierarchy":{"lvl0":"Sausage Stuffed Butternut Squash","lvl1":null,"lvl2":null,"lvl3":null,"lvl4":null,"lvl5":null,"lvl6":null},"objectID":"98c8e499aa445de42559ee7191af090ef326376a","type":"content","url":"https://danroscigno.github.io/Recipes/Sausage_Stuffed_Butternut_Squash/","url_without_anchor":"https://danroscigno.github.io/Recipes/Sausage_Stuffed_Butternut_Squash/"}

Bring to a boil, then reduce to a simmer, cover, and cook for 25 minutes. \n After 25 minutes, add quinoa, stir to combine with the brown rice, cover, and continue to cook on low-medium heat for 15 minutes or until cooked and can be fluffed with a fork. \n While the grain mixture is cooking, prepare the chicken. Place the chicken breasts on a cutting board and season them generously with salt and pepper on both sides. \n In a grill pan or cast-iron skillet on medium-high heat, warm the olive oil, then add the seasoned chicken and cook for 5-6 minutes per side until cooked through or they reach an internal temperature of 165°F. Once cooked, remove them from the pan and set aside for at least 5 minutes before slicing them into thin strips or cubes. \n While the chicken is cooking, prepare the black bean and corn salsa. In a medium bowl, add the olive oil, lime juice, garlic powder, paprika, ground cumin, and a pinch of salt and whisk until well combined. Add the strained and rinsed black beans and corn and toss until well coated in the dressing. Taste and adjust seasoning with salt and pepper as needed. \n Once the grain mixture and chicken are ready, assemble the bowls. Split the cooked quinoa and rice mixture evenly across four bowls, then top with grilled chicken, black bean and corn salsa, tomatoes, avocado, a dollop of Greek yogurt, a drizzle of salsa verde, a sprinkle of chopped cilantro, and a wedge of lime. \n These bowls can be served immediately or stored in the fridge for up to 4 days. If making them ahead of time, it is best to wait and add the avocado, Greek yogurt, and salsa verde when you are ready to serve. \n \n Notes: ​ \n Although the recipe does not call for it, as it’s not part of the original Panera version, a sprinkle of Cotija cheese or feta cheese on top would be a delicious addition! \n Edit this page","hierarchy":{"lvl0":"Baja Bowl with Chicken","lvl1":null,"lvl2":null,"lvl3":null,"lvl4":null,"lvl5":null,"lvl6":null},"objectID":"97cf42158309591df8841f34d26816851e86efcb","type":"content","url":"https://danroscigno.github.io/Recipes/Baja_Bowl_with_Chicken/","url_without_anchor":"https://danroscigno.github.io/Recipes/Baja_Bowl_with_Chicken/"}

Place chicken on a rimmed baking sheet (or plate), preferably on a rack to allow air to circulate, and refrigerate uncovered for at least 1 hour and up to 24 hours.\n Step 1 \n Heat oven to 425 degrees. Remove the rack under the chicken if you’ve used one. If the chicken isn’t on a rimmed baking sheet, transfer it to one (you can line it with parchment to make clean-up easier, but it’s not necessary). Pat the legs dry with a paper towel. Drizzle chicken with the neutral oil. Roast until the chicken is golden brown and the juices run clear when the thickest part of the thigh is pricked with a fork, 30 to 40 minutes.\n Step 2 \n While chicken is in the oven, make the peanut sauce: In a medium mixing bowl, whisk together soy sauce, vinegar, garlic and ginger until combined, then whisk in sesame oil and honey. Add peanut butter and whisk until smooth. If the mixture is very thick (and this depends on your brand of peanut butter), whisk in a few tablespoons of cold water until it becomes a thick but pourable sauce.\n Step 3 \n Transfer chicken to a serving plate and carefully pour any pan juices on the baking sheet into the bowl with the peanut sauce. Whisk until combined. Taste the sauce and add more soy sauce, vinegar or honey if you’d like.\n Step 4 \n Drizzle or brush some of the peanut sauce all over chicken pieces, reserving some sauce for serving.

Cook, stirring occasionally, until the butter starts to brown and smell nutty, 10 to 12 minutes. Scrape the butter and all the browned bits into a heatproof bowl. Place the bowl over an ice bath to solidify and set aside. \n Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F. Grease three 8-inch cake pans with the 1 tablespoon butter (or spray with nonstick cooking spray) and then lightly dust with flour. \n Whisk together the 3 3/4 cups flour, baking powder, cinnamon, nutmeg, baking soda and salt in a medium bowl until well combined, then set the flour mixture aside. \n When the brown butter has solidified, scrape it into the bowl of a stand mixer fitted with the paddle attachment. Add the brown sugar and granulated sugar and beat on high speed until very light and fluffy, about 3 minutes. Scrape down the bowl and reduce the speed to medium, then add the eggs one at a time, beating after each addition and scraping the bottom of the bowl to be sure everything is well mixed. \n Add the sour cream and vanilla and beat just until well mixed, scraping down the bowl again. Add the flour mixture in three parts, alternating with the milk, beating just until incorporated. Remove the bowl from the mixer and give the batter a couple of folds with a spatula, scraping the bottom to ensure everything is evenly mixed. \n Divide the batter among the three prepared cake pans and bake until golden brown and a toothpick inserted in the center comes out mostly clean with some moist crumbs sticking to it, about 25 minutes. Place the pans on a wire rack until cool enough to handle, then invert them onto the rack and unmold the cakes. Carefully turn the cakes right-side up and let cool completely on the rack. \n For the assembly: Look at your cake layers. If any of them have a dome in the center, cut it off with a serrated knife so the entire top is flat. Place one cake layer on a cake plate or cardboard cake round. Spread vanilla frosting around the outside of one layer and then frost a 1-inch band around the top. Evenly spread half the dulce de leche in the center of the layer until you reach the 1-inch band and then sprinkle with half the sea salt. Add another cake layer and repeat with the frosting and remaining dulce de leche and sea salt. Add the last cake layer and frost the entire cake with a smooth and even layer of frosting. Refrigerate for about 30 minutes until the frosting is set and cold. \n Remove the cake from the refrigerator and place it on a serving plate or cake stand. Using a spoon, create drips with ganache around the outside of the cake from the top edge. Pour the remaining ganache in the center of the cake and spread it with an offset spatula to cover the top. Let the ganache set completely before serving. \n \n Spiced Chocolate Ganache: ​ \n Yield:  3/4 cup \n \n Place the chocolate in a heatproof bowl. Stir together the cream, cinnamon, vanilla and chili powder in a small saucepan. Heat over medium heat until it just begins to bubble around the edges, then pour it over the chocolate and let sit for about 10 seconds. Stir until smooth and shiny. Let the ganache sit until it has cooled and thickened slightly, about 5 minutes. \n Edit this page","hierarchy":{"lvl0":"Brown Butter Cake with Spiced Chocolate Ganache and Dulce de Leche","lvl1":null,"lvl2":null,"lvl3":null,"lvl4":null,"lvl5":null,"lvl6":null},"objectID":"87166a3e7f445f513e7c108a5d5c2b72fb6da6c1","type":"content","url":"https://danroscigno.github.io/Recipes/Brown_Butter_Cake_with_Spiced_Chocolate_Ganache_and_Dulce_de_Leche/","url_without_anchor":"https://danroscigno.github.io/Recipes/Brown_Butter_Cake_with_Spiced_Chocolate_Ganache_and_Dulce_de_Leche/"}

{"anchor":null,"content":"Creamy Tomato Chickpea Masala Creamy Tomato Chickpea Masala \n Main Meal   Want to make   Kim Acceptable   Indian Inspired \n Serves 4 \n 3 tablespoons (45 grams) neutral oil, butter, or ghee \n 1 large yellow onion, minced \n 2-inch piece ginger, peeled, and minced or grated \n 2 garlic cloves, minced or grated \n Kosher salt \n 1 teaspoon ground cumin \n 1 teaspoon ground turmeric \n 1/2 teaspoon garam masala \n 1 teaspoon ground coriander \n 1/2 to 1 teaspoon ground cayenne or mild chili powder \n 2 tablespoons (35 grams) tomato paste \n One 14.5-ounce can (410 grams) diced or crushed tomatoes, or 1-3/4 cups small-diced fresh tomatoes \n 3-1/2 cups (two 15.5-ounce or 440-gram cans) cooked chickpeas, drained, rinsed (see note) \n 2 to 4 tablespoons (30 to 60 grams) heavy cream \n Handful of roughly chopped fresh parsley or cilantro (optional) \n rice for serving \n I grew up in an area of New Jersey with a large South Asian population. \n Though I know my affinities for cumin, coriander, turmeric, and gin- \n ger were planted by the incredible aromas at friends&#x27; houses while their \n moms cooked dinner—and the rotis puffing on the stove we&#x27;d ooh and \n aah over—I didn&#x27;t have the confidence to try my favorite dishes at home \n until well into my twenties. Conveniently or coincidentally, I worked \n two blocks from Kalustyan&#x27;s, a spice-and-specialty wonderland, mak- \n ing it easy to stock up. I have hardly wanted to stop for one minute since. \n This is a dish I&#x27;d been craving for years but I couldn&#x27;t find the exact rec- \n ipe I was looking for. So I took parts of a few of my favorites—a chicken \n curry from Chetna Makan; a chana masala from Madhur Jaffrey; and \n dal makhani, a black-lentil-and-red-kidney-bean curry enriched with \n butter and cream—and adjusted everything to get to what I&#x27;d envi- \n sioned, which is a more tomato-forward and lightly creamy take on \n makhani chole (butter chickpeas). The result is so warming, spiced, and \n lush, I had to stop writing this headnote midway to add ingredients for \n this to my grocery list, because thinking about it again made me crave \n it so much. I hope it has this kind of effect on you, too. \n In a medium-large (3-quart) heavy pan with a lid, heat the oil over medium- \n high heat. Once it&#x27;s hot, add the onion and cook for 5 to 7 minutes, until \n the onion is browned at the edges. Add the ginger and garlic, and cook \n for 1 minute more. Add 1 teaspoon salt, cumin, turmeric, garam masala, \n coriander, and cayenne, to taste, and cook for 2 minutes. Add the tomato \n paste, and cook until it is one shade darker, 1 to 2 minutes. Add the \n tomatoes, stirring up any stuck bits, season with another 1-1/2 teaspoons \n salt, and bring to a simmer, stirring. Cook the tomatoes until they begin \n to break down and look saucy, mashing them a bit with your spoon if \n needed, which takes between 4 and 8 minutes. (Fresh tomatoes cook \n down faster.) Add 1-1/4 cups water, stir to combine, and reduce the heat to \n the lowest simmer. Cover, and cook for 5 minutes; then add chickpeas, \n and cook for another 10 minutes, until they have slightly softened \n If the chickpea mixture looks dry or thick, add more water to loosen. Taste, and adjust the seasoning if needed. Remove from the heat, and stir in 2 tablespoons cream. Gaze at the color and ask yourself if you&#x27;re in more of a red, orange, or pink mood today. If the last, add the remaining 2 tablespoons cream. Finish with herbs, if using, and serve with rice. \n Notes: \n I sometimes add some toasted paneer or halloumi cubes here as luxurious croutons. Cut an 8-ounce package of paneer or halloumi into 1-inch pieces. In a large nonstick skillet, heat 1 tablespoon of a neutral oil over medium heat. Cook the cheese until it&#x27;s golden underneath, then flip and lightly brown on the second side. Add to the pot of chickpeas—the warmth will keep them soft— right before serving. \n The biggest debate in my household over this dish is whether it should be entirely chickpeas (my favorite) or one part chickpeas and one part cauliflower (my husband&#x27;s). Both are excellent. If you&#x27;d like to add cauliflower, reduce the chickpeas to one can, the water to 1 cup; then add 3 cups cauliflower chopped into 1/2 -to-1-inch pieces (about 1 pound total, from half a large head). Add the cauliflower when you add the water, and give it 10 minutes to begin softening before adding the chickpeas. The dish is done when the cauliflower is at your desired level of tenderness.

Remove 6 semi-packed tablespoons (about 115 grams) and set it aside; this will be your crumbs. Add the yogurt and eggs to the big bowl of crumbs, and whisk to combine; it&#x27;s okay if it doesn&#x27;t get totally smooth. Add the baking powder, baking soda, cinnamon, and ginger, and whisk well. Stir in the remaining flour and chopped peaches just until the flour disappears. \n Spoon the muffin batter into the prepared cups; it will fill them nearly to \n the top. Arrange two or three fanned slices of peach on top of each. Divide \n the reserved streusel over the muffins, using it up. Nudge any that spills \n off back onto the cups of batter. \n Bake for 20 to 22 minutes , or until a toothpick inserted under the peach \n slices comes out batter-free. Let the muffins rest in the baking tin for \n 5 minutes before removing. Eat these warm or at room temperature. \n do ahead:  Leftover muffins keep for 2 days at room temperature; I like to keep \n them in their baking pan but uncovered. The peach slices on top keep things \n moist, but the air keeps the crumbs from getting mushy. \n note:  These also taste great with 1/2 teaspoon ground cardamom added. You can use other stone fruit here, too— nectarines, plums, or apricots— \n but be sure you have 1-1/2 cups chopped, plus slices for decoration.

Much of the pectin is in the cores and flavor in the peels. Cut out damaged parts.\nQuarter the apples: \n Cook the apples: \n \n Put the quartered apples into large pot, add the vinegar and water, cover, bring to a boil, reduce heat to simmer, cook until apples are soft, about 20 minutes. Remove from heat. \n \n Push the apples through a food mill: \n \n Ladle apple mixture (cooked apples and liquid) into a chinois sieve (or food mill) and using a pestle force pulp from the chinois into a large bowl below. \n \n Add sugar, spices, lemon zest, and juice: \n \n Measure resulting apple pulp. Add 1/3 to 1/2 cup of sugar for each cup of apple pulp. Stir to dissolve sugar. Add cinnamon, ground cloves, allspice, lemon zest, lemon juice, and a pinch of salt. Taste and adjust seasonings if necessary. \n \n Cook the apple mixture and stir often: \n \n Cook the apple sugar mixture uncovered in a large, wide, thick-bottomed pot on medium low heat, stirring often to prevent burning. Scrape the bottom of the pot while you stir to make sure a crust is not forming at the bottom. \n \n \n Cook until thick, smooth, and dark brown in color (about 1 to 2 hours). A small bit spooned onto a chilled (in the freezer) plate will be thick, not runny. \n \n \n You can also cook the puree on low heat, stirring only occasionally, but this will take much longer as stirring encourages evaporation. (Note the wider the pan the better, as there is more surface for evaporation.) \n \n \n If you went with the lower amount of sugar, taste the apple butter and add a little more sugar if you think it needs it. \n \n \n Note:  Try giving this apple butter a day two to age before you enjoy it. On the day it&#x27;s made, it can taste quite sharp. After a few days, it mellows out and the flavors meld. \n How To Can the Apple Butter ​ \n \n \n Midway through cooking the apple butter down, place a steamer rack in a large stockpot, and place 6 to 8 (8-ounce) canning jars on the rack. Fill the jars and the pot with water up to the rim of the jars.\nBring to a boil and reduce to a simmer.\nWash the lids in hot, soapy water. \n \n (Because the jars will be processed in a water bath for 10 minutes, you do not need to sterilize the jars. They do, however, need to be warm.)\nPrep the canning jars: \n \n \n Remove the jars from the water bath using jar lifters. Fill the hot jars with the hot apple butter, leaving 1/4 inch headspace. Screw on the lids so they are fingertip tight.\nLower the jars into the boiling water bath. If needed, add enough water to cover the tops of the jars with at least 1 inch of water. When the water returns to a boil, process in the water bath for 10 minutes.\nRemove the jars from the water bath and set on a clean dishtowel. As the jars cool, you should hear the lids &quot;popping&quot; as they seal the jars.\nPour the apple butter into hot jars and seal: \n \n Edit this page","hierarchy":{"lvl0":"Apple Butter","lvl1":null,"lvl2":null,"lvl3":null,"lvl4":null,"lvl5":null,"lvl6":null},"objectID":"8251c6dd3ab8cd28b8e5faba9fd7bd956d9176b7","type":"content","url":"https://danroscigno.github.io/Recipes/Apple_Butter/","url_without_anchor":"https://danroscigno.github.io/Recipes/Apple_Butter/"}

{"anchor":null,"content":"TEXAS BRISKET - ON AN OFFSET SMOKER On this page TEXAS BRISKET - ON AN OFFSET SMOKER \n Author is Meat Church  19 MAY, 2021 \n I edited this to use the Texas A and M rub instead of the ones that Meat Church uses because I have some on hand. In the video the author suggests using the commercial bubs or just salt and pepper and maybe garlic. \n This is the recipe you come to Meat Church seeking. Texas brisket on an offset smoker. The Texas BBQ cooked the old school way by a Texan. Wood, fire & meat. No shortcuts, no electronics, no gimmicks. Just patience. And maybe a fair amount of cold beer.... \n There are a lot of ways to smoke briskets. In fact you have probably seen my 275 method which I typically use for a standard sized brisket that I need to get cooked in under 10 hours. However, this recipe is a very traditional Texas style and recipe that is going to take more hours to smoke and will yield and even better brisket. \n This process can be replicated as a pellet smoker or kamado style grill (indirect) brisket as well. \n \n Meat Church Cook How To YouTube Video:  https://youtu.be/Mgy7ou8bFRQ \n Meat Church Brisket Trim YouTube Video:  https://youtu.be/MTc5VAgZKLE \n \n Ingredients ​ \n \n 1 Full packer brisket. Choice grade or higher. (I used the Angus from Sam&#x27;s Club, around 12 pounds.) \n Texas A and M brisket rub \n \n Tools ​ \n \n Instant Read Thermometer \n Unwaxed butcher paper (sub heavy duty aluminum foil) \n \n Prepare your smoker ​ \n Prepare your smoker at 225 degrees with post oak. Other good alternatives would be mesquite, hickory or pecan. I prefer &quot;heavy smoke&quot; woods for this cook. Optionally you can place a pan of water in your smoker for additional moisture should you feel your smoker needs it. \n \n Note: My smoker is happy around 240 measured at the grill on the far side. The thermometer in the lid reads 280 when the grill is at 240. \n When the fire starts in the the firebox there will be alot of smoke, let the smoke fade to a shimmer before closing the door to the firebox and closing the vent on the grill down low. Thick smoke tastes bad. \n \n Trim the brisket ​ \n Trim hard and excess fat off the meat side of the brisket. Also, remove any “hard” pieces of fat as they will not render off during the cooking process. Trim the fat off the fat side of the brisket only leaving ¼ in fat. My brisket trim video will help guide you. \n Prepare the brisket ​ \n Season the rub. I typically slather with mustard as a binder. Oil, mustard, pickle juice are commonly used binders should you choose to use one. \n \n Note: I used mayo once as a binder and it was good, I also used no binder and it was good. I think going forward no binder maybe. \n \n Allow the seasoning to adhere for 15 - 20 minutes. Flip the brisket over to the fat side. Repeat the seasoning process. Season the sides as well. Allow it to adhere for 30 minutes if time allows. \n \n Note: I apply the rub the night before and let it sit for 20 minutes on the meat side before flipping. \n \n Smoke the brisket ​ \n Smoking fat side up vs meat side up is one of the hottest debates in BBQ! As we mentioned in the beginning, we are smoking this brisket the traditional Texas BBQ joint way. Place the brisket in the smoker fat-side up with the point (fatty side) of the brisket nearest the fire box. \n Leave the brisket untouched as that beautiful bark develops. Optionally you can spritz a time or two with cider vinegar or water if the brisket appears to dry out. I do not think this is needed with a fat side up brisket. That is more commonly needed when cooking a meat side up brisket.\nWhen the meat reaches an internal temperature of at least 175 (the bark will be set nicely by this point) it is time to wrap. \n \n Note: Around four hours in I move the temperature probe from the grill into the meat. When the internal temp is at least 175 I will wrap the brisket in butcher paper. The temp might be around 160 degrees in the thickest part of the brisket at 4 hours. \n \n Wrapping in butcher paper will allow you to maintain your bark. Wrap the brisket in non-waxed butcher paper. Depending on the size of your brisket this could be 6 - 8 hours into the cook. However, the time is no the most important thing to be worried about. Focus on the visual look of the bark and the internal temp. I like to spritz the inside of the paper with liquid to make the paper more more pliable before I lay the brisket on it to wrap. Our brisket cook video illustrates this process. Alternatively, wrapping in aluminum foil is a bit easier to master and will deliver a juicy, delicious brisket. \n Finishing the brisket and resting ​ \n Continue to smoke the brisket until the meat is “probe tender” in the thick part of the flat. This means when you probe it in the flat (not the point) there is no resistance. Think of sticking a toothpick in a cake. Each piece of meat is different but this will likely be around an internal temperature of 203°F. Wagyu briskets often need to be cooked to a higher internal temp close to 210 internal. \n \n Note: The 12 pound brisket I cooked was probe tender and 203 - 205 degrees at nine hours after cooking at about 240-ish degrees and being wrapped at 175 degrees. I left it wrapped in a dry cooler until it was time to eat (around two and a half hours). \n \n Remove the brisket from the smoker, and rest it still wrapped at ambient temperature on the counter for an hour. Resting at room\\ambient temp will stop the cooking process and allow the juices in the brisket to redistribute. It will be the perfect temp to slice and eat in an hour. \n If you need to hold the meat longer then rest it on the counter for 15 minutes and then place it in a cooler. An insulated cooler can hot hold a brisket safely for hours. \n Unwrap the brisket, slice only what you plan to eat and enjoy!

{"anchor":null,"content":"Ginger Garlic Chicken Noodle Soup Ginger Garlic Chicken Noodle Soup \n Main Meal   Soups   Asian Inspired \n serves 4 to 6\n \n Ingredients: \n 2 pounds (905 grams) boneless, skinless chicken thighs \n 6 garlic cloves, thinly sliced \n 3-inch piece ginger, peeled, finely chopped \n 1 bundle (6 to 8 ounces, 170 to 225 grams) scallions, thinly sliced, whites and greens separated \n 4 teaspoons(11grams) kosher salt \n Freshly ground white or black pepper \n 10 cups (2.4 kilograms) water \n 8 ounces (225 grams) dried curly (in a brick) or other dried ramen-style noodles \n 1 cup (135 grams) sliced carrot, cut into thin matchsticks (about 1/2 full-sized carrot) \n finish: \n 1/4 cup (60 grams) black rice vinegar (see note) \n 1/4 cup (60 grams) soy sauce \n 2 tablespoons (25 grams) toasted sesame oil \n crispy chili oil to taste \n On a cold winter weekend day when nobody wants to go outside, there are few better things than a pot of chicken noodle soup, quietly sim- \n mering on the stove while my family, in all likelihood, is glued to another \n Star Wars marathon. But on a cold winter weekend day when nobody \n wants to go outside but we also don&#x27;t want to spend the afternoon long- \n cooking a pot of bone broth? This, this is the soup we make. \n One of my favorite discoveries of the last few years was that I didn&#x27;t \n actually need to make, to buy, or even to build-from-bouillon chicken \n stock to make chicken noodle soup. It turns out that just simmering \n boneless, skinless chicken thighs with aromatics in salted water creates \n a gentle but delicious soup-building base. With ginger, garlic, scallions, \n and a punchy seasoning added at the end, all efforts to explain calmly \n how much I love this soup fall short. This is the first recipe I worked on for \n this book, and, for us, the very definition of a keeper. A deeply flavored \n chicken noodle soup you can make in 45 minutes is one we&#x27;re going to \n want to make as often as possible. \n A few things here are key: Chicken thigh cutlets have more fat than \n breast cutlets, and the richness helps build a more flavorful soup here. \n Adding the soy sauce, vinegar, and sesame oil at the end as a salty, robust \n finish, versus cooking them into the broth, keeps them from getting lost \n in the soup. This gives it a bit of a hot-and-sour-soup note, too, which is \n also finished with vinegar. \n Bring the chicken, garlic, ginger, scallion whites (reserve greens), salt, pepper, and water to a boil in a 4-to-5-quart pot. Reduce the heat to medium- \n low, and simmer, uncovered, stirring occasionally, until the chicken is very \n tender and cooked through, about 15 minutes. \n While the soup simmers, whisk together the vinegar, soy sauce, and \n sesame oil in a bowl, and add as much or as little chili crisp as your \n heart desires. (Mine desires a lot, but, to keep the less spice-inclined \n kids happy, we use just a smidge and add more to our bowls at the table.) \n Remove the chicken with tongs, and transfer it to a cutting board. Add the noodles and carrot to the broth, following the cooking-time estimate on your noodles&#x27; package directions. Use two forks to shred the chicken into bite-sized pieces. Once the noodles are done, return the chicken to the pot, and rewarm for 1 minute. Taste, adjusting seasoning if needed. \n Divide the soup between bowls. Add a handful of scallion greens, and drizzle each bowl with 1 tablespoon of the soy-sauce mixture, adding more to taste. \n Notes: \n Deeper in color and flavor, black vinegar (also sold as black rice vinegar and Chinkiang vinegar) should be very easy to find in an Asian grocery store or online, and I love it here for flavor and color. Should you seek it out, you can also use it for the Soy-Glazed Tofu with Crisped Rice (page 129), which helps give it that dark glaze. \n Cook the noodles in the soup right before you want to serve it, or they will keep &quot;drinking&quot; the broth until there&#x27;s little left.

If using a charcoal grill, build hot coals on one side only. If using a gas grill, heat one side only to medium-high heat. \n For the meatballs: Combine the ground chicken, ricotta, Parmesan, breadcrumbs, parsley, nutmeg, garlic, egg and onion in a medium bowl until just mixed. Do not overwork. Season with salt and pepper. Divide the mixture into 8 portions and roll into balls.  \n Heat a cast-iron pan on the hot side of the grill until nice and hot. Brush the pan with enough olive oil to liberally coat the surface, about 3 tablespoons. \n Place the meatballs in the pan and cook, flipping them, until all sides are caramelized, about 3 minutes. Move the pan to the indirect-heat side of the grill and cover the grill. Cook for 5 minutes. \n For the sauce: Add the garlic, oregano and onion to the pan with the meatballs and saute until the onions begin to soften, 2 to 3 minutes. Flip the meatballs, then add the tomato puree and 1/2 cup water. Season with salt and pepper. Cover the grill and continue to cook until the chicken is cooked through and the sauce is reduced slightly, 10 to 15 minutes. \n For topping and serving: Top the meatballs with the mozzarella, cover the grill and cook until the cheese is melted, about 3 minutes. Discard the oregano sprig. Spoon the meatballs on top of the Soft Polenta. Spoon any remaining sauce over top and serve topped with the Parmesan and basil if using.  \n (Alternatively, you can cook the meatballs and the sauce as directed in a cast-iron skillet on the stovetop over medium heat, then transfer the skillet to a 400 degrees F oven for 10 to 15 minutes before melting the cheese.) \n \n Soft Polenta: \n \n Add 4 1/2 cups water, 1 tablespoon salt and the olive oil to a medium saucepot and bring to a simmer over medium heat. Whisk in the cornmeal in a steady stream, until it is all incorporated and smooth. Reduce the heat to medium low and continue to cook at a simmer until the polenta is creamy and fully hydrated, 30 to 40 minutes. Take the saucepot off the heat and whisk in the butter and Parmesan. Season with additional salt and pepper. Transfer the polenta to a large serving bowl. \n \n Note:  Serve with Mom’s Salad (see recipe in salads). Can also serve with crusty bread!

Grease two 9-inch round cake pans and line the bottom of each with parchment paper. Grease the parchment paper, then dust with flour, tapping out excess. \n Finely grind the coconut in a food processor, then transfer to a bowl. Add pecans to the food processor, along with 2 tablespoons sugar, and finely grind them. \n In a large bowl, sift together flour, baking powder and salt. Stir in coconut and pecans. \n In the bowl of a mixer fitted with the paddle attachment, beat butter, cream of coconut and the remaining sugar on high speed until light and fluffy, about 4 minutes. Add eggs one at a time, mixing well after each addition and scraping down the bowl as necessary, then beat in coconut extract. \n Add the flour mixture in 3 batches, alternating with the coconut milk, starting and ending with flour mixture. Divide batter between the pans and smooth the top of each with a spatula. Bake until cakes are golden and a tester comes out clean, 30 to 35 minutes. Let cakes cool in the pans on a wire rack for 30 minutes. Run a knife around the edge of each cake, invert onto rack, and remove the parchment. Let cool completely. \n Meanwhile, make the filling: Place egg yolks in a small heatproof bowl and set aside. In a saucepan, combine condensed milk, butter and cream of coconut and cook over medium-low heat, stirring constantly, until hot, about 4 minutes. Whisk 1/3 of the hot milk into the egg yolks. Transfer egg mixture to the saucepan of milk and whisk constantly over medium-low heat until mixture has the consistency of pudding, about 4 minutes. Do not let the custard get too thick. Transfer to a bowl and stir in the shredded coconut. Let cool completely. \n Make the simple syrup: In a saucepan, heat sugar and 1/2 cup water, stirring occasionally, until sugar has dissolved. Remove from heat. \n Assemble the layer cake in a pan: Cut each cake in half horizontally. Place one layer in the bottom of a 9-inch cake pan, moisten the top with 2 to 3 tablespoons simple syrup and spread 1/2 cup of the coconut filling in a thin, even layer with an offset spatula. Repeat to make 2 more layers of cake and filling, then place the last layer on top. Refrigerate cake for about 1 hour. To unmold, run a spatula around the edges, invert a cake plate over the top, and flip the cake over onto the plate. \n Make the icing: Whip the cream with the confectioners’ sugar and coconut extract until stiff peaks form. Spread on the top and sides of the cake and sprinkle with toasted coconut. Refrigerate until ready to serve. \n Edit this page","hierarchy":{"lvl0":"Dolester Miles’ Coconut Pecan Cake","lvl1":null,"lvl2":null,"lvl3":null,"lvl4":null,"lvl5":null,"lvl6":null},"objectID":"6c3ea37ee24d0aef227d36488ca1b20e8d10344a","type":"content","url":"https://danroscigno.github.io/Recipes/Dolester_Miles_Coconut_Pecan_Cake/","url_without_anchor":"https://danroscigno.github.io/Recipes/Dolester_Miles_Coconut_Pecan_Cake/"}

Beat on medium speed for 1 minute. \n Add 1/3 of flour mixture and beat on medium speed until incorporated. \n Add half of buttermilk and beat on medium until mixed in. \n Scrape down sides of bowl and repeat adding flour mixture and buttermilk, finishing with remaining 1/3 of flour. \n Batter will be thick and glossy. \n Pour batter evenly into prepared pans, I like to use an ice cream scoop because the batter is so thick. \n Set two cake pans on 1 oven rack and the third pan on the second rack, staggering them so cakes are not directly over each other. \n Bake 25 to 35 minutes, until the tops are flat and browned. \n Cool cakes in pans for 10 minutes. \n Invert onto racks to cool completely. (Cakes can be wrapped in plastic wrap and frozen for up to 3 weeks.) \n \n For the pumpkin cheesecake filling: \n \n Using a stand mixer with the paddle attachment, beat together the cream cheese and the sugar. \n Mix until light and fluffy, about 3 minutes. \n Add the pumpkin puree and pumpkin pie spice and beat until fully combined. \n Transfer mixture to a large bowl. \n Clean bowl. \n Pour in heavy cream and using the whisk attachment beat until stiff peaks form. \n Fold the heavy cream into the pumpkin mixture until fully incorporated. \n Cover with plastic wrap and refrigerate while you make buttercream. \n \n For the buttercream: \n \n In the bowl of an electric stand mixer, add the egg whites and granulated sugar.  \n Whisk them together briefly by hand, just until they are combined so that the egg whites don’t begin cooking by themselves. \n Fill a sauce pan with a few inches of water and bring to a simmer.  \n Place the mixer bowl with the egg white mixture on top to create a double-boiler. \n The water should be kept at a simmer but should not touch the bottom of the bowl.  \n The double-boiler acts as indirect heat for the egg white mixture. \n Occasionally stirring, heat the egg white mixture until it reaches 155 to 160 degrees F on a candy thermometer.  \n The mixture should be very hot to the touch and the sugar should have dissolved. \n Once the egg white mixture is hot, carefully return the bowl to the stand mixer.  \n Fitted with the whisk attachment, beat the mixture on high speed for about 8 minutes.  \n When done, the meringue should hold shiny, medium-stiff peaks and be cooled to room temperature.  \n Stop the mixer and swap out the whisk for the paddle attachment. \n With the mixer on low, begin adding in the butter a couple tablespoons at a time.  \n Use the paddle attachment to mix it in.  \n The butter must be room temperature in order to incorporate properly with the meringue. \n Once the butter has been mixed in, add the vanilla extract. \n Turn the mixer up to medium speed and mix until silky smooth.  \n This may take a few minutes, but centime to mix until light, creamy, and free from most air bubbles. \n \n To assemble: \n \n Once the cakes are cooled, trim the tops as needed with a large serrated knife. \n Place the bottom layer of cake on a cake board or serving dish. \n Spread on 1/2 of the pumpkin cheesecake filling with an offset spatula. \n Top with the next layer of cake and repeat. \n Crumb coat and frost the cake with the buttercream. \n Edit this page","hierarchy":{"lvl0":"Buttermilk Bourbon Cheesecake Layer Cake","lvl1":null,"lvl2":null,"lvl3":null,"lvl4":null,"lvl5":null,"lvl6":null},"objectID":"6abc501b9e834e17260264da1c53dffe79041053","type":"content","url":"https://danroscigno.github.io/Recipes/Buttermilk_Bourbon_Cheesecake_Layer_Cake/","url_without_anchor":"https://danroscigno.github.io/Recipes/Buttermilk_Bourbon_Cheesecake_Layer_Cake/"}

Roast at 425 degrees for about 20 minutes, until they&#x27;re tender and the juices are starting to spill out on to the pan. \n Place the plums into a blender, taking care to scrape up any juices on your baking sheet and add those to the blender (you don&#x27;t want to lose that condensed flavor magic!). Add ground cardamom and puree until smooth. \n Place your puree in the fridge to cool.  \n Custard: \n Using a stand mixer with the whisk attachment, a hand mixer, or a really super strong arm - whisk together the egg yolks and 1/2 cup of the sugar until it doubles in size, lightens to a pale yellow, and gains a silky ribbony texture. This should take a few minutes.  \n Heat the cream, remaining 1/4 cup sugar, cardamom pods, and ground or bean vanilla (wait until later in the process if you&#x27;re using the extract) to a scald, which is before a simmer but nice and steamy.  \n With the mixer running, slowly pour the cream mixture into the yolks until fully combined to temper your eggs. Then pour the mixture back into the pot and heat over medium heat until your custard has formed (if you don&#x27;t feel comfortable knowing when that is, use a thermometer and look for 180 degrees). While it&#x27;s heating, use a silicone spatula to gently scrape the bottom of the pan and stir slowly.  \n When you&#x27;ve reached 180 degrees, strain the custard through a fine mesh sieve into a medium bowl, and set that bowl into a larger one with a bit of ice and water in it to create a cooling water bath. Spin the inner bowl with one hand, while holding your spatula in the custard like a rudder to help the mixture cool evenly.  \n Once it has cooled significantly, stir in the plum puree (and the vanilla extract if you&#x27;re using it) until fully combined and let chill for a few hours.  \n Ice Cream: \n Churn based on your machine&#x27;s instructions. I have a  Cuisinart 2 Quart ice cream maker , and this recipe filled it to the brim.

{"anchor":null,"content":"Two Bean Salad with Basil Vinaigrette Two Bean Salad with Basil Vinaigrette \n Salads   Main Meal   Want to make   Kim Acceptable   Italian Inspired \n serves 2 as a meal, or 4 sides\n \n Ingredients: \n 1/2 pound (225 grams) regular green beans or skinnier haricots verts \n One 15.5-ounce (440-gram) can large white beans, drained and rinsed \n 1/2 medium fennel bulb, trimmed and thinly sliced (115 grams, or 1 cup) \n 2 tablespoons (25 grams) drained capers \n 1-1/2 cups (30 grams) fresh basil leaves \n 1 teaspoon smooth Dijon mustard \n 2 tablespoons (30 grams) red- or white-wine vinegar \n 5 tablespoons (70 grams) olive oil \n Kosher salt and freshly ground \n black pepper \n 1/2 cup (50 grams) Parmesan, chopped into mixed-sized rubble (optional) \n Right after your smiling faces—sorry, that was grimacingly twee— \n a bowl of this salad is the thing I want to see most on a blanket at \n a summer picnic. Why? It&#x27;s a marinated salad that is excellent fresh or, \n later, cold or at room temperature. Long beans, short beans, something \n crunchy, an herb dressing—this is an oasis of summer freshness and tex- \n ture. The cheese is optional, in case you wish to keep it dairy-free or just \n want to home in on the fresher ingredients. The crunch is not, but there&#x27;s \n some flexibility here as to how you get to it. The star is the basil vinai- \n grette, which is what happens when you crave pesto but want the acidity \n of a vinaigrette. It goes well on everything in the summer, so, if you have \n an overflowing basil plant about to flower, whack it down and make a \n big jar of this dressing. Your tomatoes, grilled summer squash, and even \n grain or lentil salads will thank you. \n If you do not care for fennel, you can replace it here with 1 cup of \n thinly sliced celery. Oh, you don&#x27;t like celery, either? Try half a white \n onion, thinly sliced. No raw onion, eh? You could add some thinly sliced \n radishes, because crunch is important here. But I think you are missing \n out on the fennel. \n Trim the green beans, and cut them into large segments. In salted water, \n boil the green beans for 2 minutes (1-1/2 minutes for haricots verts), until \n crisp-tender, heavier on the crisp. Drain the beans, and plunge them into \n ice water to cool them fully. Drain again, pat them dry on a towel, and \n place them in a large bowl. Add the white beans, fennel, and capers. \n In a food processor or blender, combine the basil, Dijon mustard, and vinegar until the herbs are well chopped. With the machine running, drizzle \n in 5 tablespoons olive oil in a thin stream. Season very well with salt and \n black pepper; then add more vinegar and/or oil to taste. You might need \n to scrape the machine down a few times to get all of the leaves minced. \n Pour the vinaigrette over the beans and turn to coat them in the bowl. Add \n the cheese, if using. Taste, and adjust seasoning.

Add cold water to cover by 2 inches (about 5 quarts). Bring to a boil, then reduce to a simmer. Simmer, uncovered, until the chicken is very tender, for at least 1 1/2 hours (or up to 2 hours if you have the time. The longer the better!) Add more water, as needed, skimming off scum (there won’t be much) and, if desired, some fat. \n Carefully strain the stock, discarding everything except for the chicken. (You should have 3 1/2 to 4 1/2 quarts of stock.) Set the chicken aside to cool briefly while you put together the rest of the soup. Return the strained stock to the pot and bring it to a simmer. Add the sliced carrot, sliced celery, chopped onion, sliced parsnip, chopped dill, chopped parsley and the salt. Bring to a boil and reduce to a simmer. Simmer, covered, for 20 minutes. \n Meanwhile, prepare the dumplings: In a small saucepan, bring the butter and 3/4 cup water to a boil. Remove from the heat and stir in the flour. Let cool for a few minutes so it’s not so hot that it will cook the eggs, then whisk in the salt, sugar, nutmeg and the eggs, one at a time, until incorporated into a slightly lumpy thick batter. (It’ll take a little work to whisk in the eggs.) \n Drop heaping teaspoons of the dumpling mixture into the simmering soup, then cover and cook until the vegetables are tender and the dumplings are cooked through; begin checking for doneness at 15 minutes. \n Pull the chicken meat off the bones and chop into bite-sized pieces. Season it with salt, then add it to the soup along with the ground black pepper. Taste and add more salt as needed. This is important: The amount of salt in a chicken soup can mean the difference between unappetizing chicken tea and the elixir of bubble love that it should be. So don’t skip this step, and don’t rush it, either. Taste your soup, and if it doesn’t make you smile reflexively, add more salt, about a 1/2 teaspoon of it, and give it a few good stirs so it can dissolve. Taste and repeat, as needed, until it tastes good. \n Serve, garnishing with fresh parsley. \n Edit this page","hierarchy":{"lvl0":"Chicken and Dumpling Soup","lvl1":null,"lvl2":null,"lvl3":null,"lvl4":null,"lvl5":null,"lvl6":null},"objectID":"49b0719c14c019d56f80300bab6d9574b042470e","type":"content","url":"https://danroscigno.github.io/Recipes/Chicken_and_Dumpling_Soup/","url_without_anchor":"https://danroscigno.github.io/Recipes/Chicken_and_Dumpling_Soup/"}

It&#x27;s usually during lunch on a weekday, which on all of the days when I&#x27;m not working on a wildly successful, ready-by-1:00-p.m. recipe that I don&#x27;t need to save for dinner—that would be just about all of the days—is highly likely to be a peanut-butter-and-jelly sandwich. When I do make time for experimentation, canned beans are one of my favorite muses. My two favorite things to do with them are to treat them as you would pasta—warming them in some tomato sauce with Parmesan, or an aglio olio, or a basil pesto—or to apply a favorite salad dressing to them and scoop them onto toast. This version is a little of both. To a quadfecta of ingredients—olive oil, garlic, anchovies, and lemon—that could make a crumpled piece of paper taste good (note: not fact-checked), I add a smidge of Dijon mustard and a small amount of capers (they&#x27;re so good here; please, try them), and warm a can of beans in it. They&#x27;re finished with some fried breadcrumbs reminiscent of the croutons essential to all good Caesar salads, and Parmesan, and then you&#x27;re supposed to slide them onto a bowl or plate—but nobody \n is going to know if you eat them straight from the pan. \n In a medium-sized skillet, warm 1 to 2 tablespoons of olive oil over medium \n heat; then add the breadcrumbs. Season with salt, and cook, stirring, \n until they&#x27;re crisp and evenly golden brown, about 5 minutes. Scrape them \n into a bowl and set aside. \n On a cutting board, mince together the garlic, anchovies, and capers. Heat \n another 2 tablespoons of olive oil in the skillet over medium-high heat. \n Add the garlic-caper mixture, pepper flakes, and zest, and cook until the garlic is lightly golden at the edges. Add the beans, and cook until they&#x27;re warmed through, 2 to 3 minutes. Stir in the Dijon mustard, and cook with the beans for 30 seconds. The beans will look a little creamy; add 1 table- spoon water if they don&#x27;t. Season with salt to taste. Turn the heat off, and finish with a squeeze of lemon juice. Transfer to a bowl or plate, and finish with crumbs, Parmesan, and parsley, if using. Eat right away.

It&#x27;s a vividly colored crunchy, nutty, and spicy mix of asparagus, carrots, and avocado, springlike vegetables that, rather conveniently in a place where &quot;spring&quot; vegetables may not emerge from the soil until spring is two-thirds over, taste pretty great from the produce we find at the grocery store. I know that mayo is a highly controversial ingredient, but mayo seasoned with toasted sesame oil and soy sauce is a whole other thing, a thing I refuse to believe anyone wouldn&#x27;t want to lick from a spoon. It&#x27;s rivetingly good. Here, it dresses the crunchy vegetables and rich cubes of avocado in a way that lightly coats them but, I promise, doesn&#x27;t scream &quot;mayo salad&quot; in any way. This is one of my favorite lunch salads, and you should not believe the serving suggestion at all: the recipe is just for you. \n Hold the asparagus by the tough end (no need to snap it off) and carrots by the stem end, and cut each diagonally into thin slices. Place these in a large bowl, and dress with rice vinegar and a few pinches of salt. \n Combine the mayonnaise, sesame oil, sriracha, and soy sauce in a small bowl, whisking until smooth. \n When you&#x27;re ready to eat the salad, add the dressing to the asparagus and carrots, and stir to coat evenly.

Set aside. \n For the three cheese waffle hash browns: Preheat a waffle iron to medium. \n Toss the shredded potatoes in a bowl with the melted butter, the three cheeses and the salt and pepper. Mix until well combined. \n Spray the top and bottom of the waffle iron well with cooking spray. Put a mounded cup of the potato mixture (about 1 1/4 cups worth) in each well and gently pat down. (They will start to sizzle.) \n Close the waffle iron and cook until the hash browns are golden brown and crispy; time will vary based on your waffle iron, but it will take roughly 12 minutes. (Check on them occasionally to make sure they aren&#x27;t burning.) Use a butter knife or fish spatula to gently and very carefully remove the hash browns. They are very fragile when they are hot and just out of the iron. \n For the flank steak: Meanwhile, preheat a grill or grill pan to medium-high. Pat the steak dry and sprinkle liberally with salt and pepper. Grill the steak for about 5 minutes on each side for medium-rare. Set on a cutting board to rest for 10 minutes. \n Thinly slice the steak against the grain. Divide the hash browns and steak among 4 plates and drizzle the steak with the herb sauce. \n Edit this page","hierarchy":{"lvl0":"Flank Steak with Herb Sauce and Three Cheese Waffle Hash Browns","lvl1":null,"lvl2":null,"lvl3":null,"lvl4":null,"lvl5":null,"lvl6":null},"objectID":"40e63784670546bd6be81e4f036f247775a052a2","type":"content","url":"https://danroscigno.github.io/Recipes/Flank_Steak_with_Herb_Sauce_and_Three_Cheese_Waffle_Hash_Browns/","url_without_anchor":"https://danroscigno.github.io/Recipes/Flank_Steak_with_Herb_Sauce_and_Three_Cheese_Waffle_Hash_Browns/"}

(I do not use the water, the juice from the apple and orange are enough). The spices and chopped nuts are added to the ground fig mixture.

Wrap dough over mixture, sealing figs inside dough. Trim to desired length, using a diagonal cut. Make small diagonal slits in the sides of the cookies.

Toss the chickpeas with 2 T olive oil, 1/4 tsp coarse salt, freshly ground black pepper and ground cumin. Spread them on a baking sheet, and roast on top rack for 30-40 minutes, rolling them around on tray from time to time, until they turn browned and crisp. (If you use fresh chickpeas and not canned, they cook/crisp faster.) \n Roast Eggplant: \n Brush a large baking sheet or roasting pan with a generous Tablespoon of oil. Half the eggplants lengthwise, arrange them, cut side up, in one layer on oiled pan. Brush the cut sides lightly with a tiny amount of oil, and sprinkle them with generously with salt and black pepper. Roast for 15 minutes until they are browned on top. Carefully flip the eggplants so their cut sides are against the pan, and roast another 15 minutes, until they are bronzed underneath and tender throughout. (If you are using larger eggplants, you may need to adjust cooking times slightly.) \n Yogurt-Tahini Sauce: \n Whisk together tahini, yogurt, lemon juice, garlic, and salt; the mixture will become very thick and stiff. Add water, a tablespoon at a time, until mixture is smooth, with a thick but pourable consistency. \n Putting together: \n Arrange the eggplant sections, cut side up, on a large platter.

Add the granulated sugar and mix on medium until it holds stiff peaks. Add the powdered sugar and salt and whisk on medium-high to tighten, about 1 minute.

Turn the heat on medium-high and cook, constantly stirring with a rubber spatula in a figure 8 motion until it coats the back of a spoon, about 10 minutes. Stir in the butter, salt and 1 cup cream until completely combined. Remove from the heat and pour through a fine mesh strainer into a shallow dish. Allow to cool for a minute or two before covering with plastic wrap, touching the curd to prevent a skin from forming.

Place a rack in a roasting pan. Rub 1 tablespoon salt around the inside of the cavity, then stuff it with the thyme, lemon and garlic. Tie the legs closed with cooking twine. Rub olive oil over the entire bird, and sprinkle with 1/2 tablespoon salt and the black pepper. Place on the rack and roast for 72 to 80 minutes. After 72 minutes, begin testing for doneness by inserting a meat thermometer into the leg, close to the bone. The chicken is done when the thermometer reads 165 degrees. Remove from oven and set aside to cool. \n When cool enough to handle, remove the skin from the chicken. Use your hands to remove all the meat (remember, it will be hotter internally) and shred into 2-inch strips. If you’re not going to make the salad for a few hours, place the meat in the refrigerator, but be sure to remove it and let come to room temperature for 30 to 45 minutes before serving, to bring out the best flavor. \n Make the dressing: Place all the ingredients except the oil in a food processor and pulse for about 30 seconds, until everything is combined. With the machine on low, slowly drizzle in the oil until dressing is emulsified. \n Assemble the salad: Drizzle pears with lemon juice to prevent them from browning. In a large mixing bowl, combine pears, greens, beans, tomatoes, onion, avocado and half the chicken meat. Add some of the dressing and toss to make sure everything is lightly coated, adding more dressing if needed. Divide the mixture equally among 4 or 6 plates. Lay the rest of the chicken on top and serve immediately, passing the remaining dressing in case people want to add more. \n \n Tip ​ \n \n To blanch the string beans, bring a small saucepan filled with about 2 inches of water to a simmer.

Mix the remaining dulce de leche with the remaining 3/4 cup vanilla frosting; transfer to a piping bag fitted with a large round tip (this will be your lighter frosting). \n Starting in the center of the cake, pipe concentric circles of the darker frosting out to about a 2-inch circle. Using a small offset spatula, spread out the frosting to about a 3-inch circle. \n With the lighter frosting, pipe concentric circles around the 3-inch circle, leaving about a 1-inch margin around the edge of the cake. Using a clean offset spatula, smooth the lighter frosting to the edge of the cake, so the entire top of the cake is covered. Smooth everything with a clean offset spatula. \n Line the point of a cake comb with the center of the cake and slowly rotate the cake to create concentric tree rings. When the lines of the circle meet, gently lift the comb (if you don&#x27;t have a cake comb, this effect can be recreated using the tines of a fork). \n Make the chocolate bark: Line a baking sheet with a silicone baking mat and set aside. \n Separately melt the dark and milk chocolates over a double boiler or in the microwave. Pour the dark chocolate over the prepared baking sheet, using an offset spatula to spread to the width of the baking sheet but not smoothing out the chocolate. Drizzle the melted milk chocolate on top. Using the edge of a small offset spatula or a butter knife, make vertical lines and swirls running through the chocolate to create the look of tree bark. Be sure to apply various levels of pressure as the offset spatula is pulled through the chocolate to create a textured look. Let cool at room temperature until firmly set, at least 30 minutes. \n Break the chocolate into large vertical pieces of varying heights to form pieces of bark. Use these pieces to cover the sides of the cake. \n Make the berry mushrooms: Roll 1/2-inch pieces of marzipan between your fingers into stem shapes, making them wider at the base so they can stand upright. Place a stem inside the hollow of each raspberry and strawberry, using a skewer to secure the marzipan to the fruit if needed and to secure them down into the cake. Make mushrooms of various sizes and shapes to give a more natural effect and use the mushrooms to decorate the tops and sides of the cake, pressing gently to adhere the marzipan to the surface. \n Make the pistachio moss and marshmallow stones: Put the pistachios in a mini food processor and add approximately 8 drops each of the green and yellow food coloring. Pulse the food processor to chop the pistachios to a coarse grind the texture of moss. Adjust the food coloring as needed to achieve the desired color. Spoon the moss around the cake plate alongside the bottom of the cake. \n Mix the mini marshmallows and cocoa in a small bowl. Rough up the marshmallows between your fingers to create texture, shaking off the excess cocoa powder. Add the stones to the base of the cake on the pistachio moss. \n Using a fine-mesh strainer, shake confectioners&#x27; sugar over the top of the cake, creating a snowy effect. \n Edit this page","hierarchy":{"lvl0":"Stump de Noel","lvl1":null,"lvl2":null,"lvl3":null,"lvl4":null,"lvl5":null,"lvl6":null},"objectID":"1ffaa74e26c9c0f738a170009be223774fffc502","type":"content","url":"https://danroscigno.github.io/Recipes/Stump_de_Noel/","url_without_anchor":"https://danroscigno.github.io/Recipes/Stump_de_Noel/"}

{"anchor":null,"content":"Famous Department Store Gluten Free Blueberry Muffins Famous Department Store Gluten Free Blueberry Muffins \n Gluten Free   Breads \n YIELD: 12 muffins \n These muffins are a clone of &quot;The Famous Jordan Marsh Blueberry Muffins&quot; — which were indeed famous up until the mid-1990s, when Jordan&#x27;s, one of Boston&#x27;s two iconic department stores (Filene&#x27;s being the other) was absorbed by Macy&#x27;s and effectively disappeared. \n These overstuffed muffins, with their signature sugary crown, were served in the Jordan Marsh dining room on the top floor of the store, where dedicated shoppers went to rest and compare purchases while sipping tea and enjoying a muffin — blueberry, of course. \n \n \n 1/2 cup (8 tablespoons) butter, at room temperature \n \n \n 1 cup sugar \n \n \n 2 large eggs \n \n \n 2 teaspoons baking powder \n \n \n 1/2 teaspoon salt \n \n \n 1 teaspoon vanilla extract \n \n \n 2 cups King Arthur Gluten Free baking mix \n \n \n 1/2 cup milk \n \n \n 2 1/2 cups blueberries, fresh preferred \n \n \n lemon zest and lemon drizzle \n \n \n 1/4 cup sugar, for topping \n \n \n Directions \n \n \n Preheat the oven to 375°F. Lightly grease a standard 12-cup muffin tin; or line the tin with papers, and grease the papers. \n \n \n In a medium-sized bowl, beat together the butter and sugar until well combined. \n \n \n Add the eggs one at a time, scraping the sides and bottom of the bowl and beating well after each addition. \n \n \n Beat in the baking powder, salt, and vanilla. \n \n \n Add the flour alternately with the milk, beating gently just to combine. Scrape the bottom and sides of the bowl. \n \n \n Mash 1/2 cup of the blueberries. Add the mashed and whole berries to the batter, stirring just to combine and distribute. \n \n \n Scoop the batter by the heaping 1/4-cupful into the prepared muffin pan; a muffin scoop works well here. \n \n \n Sprinkle about 1 teaspoon granulated sugar atop each muffin, if desired. It&#x27;s traditional — go for it! \n \n \n Bake the muffins for about 30 minutes, until they&#x27;re light golden brown on top, and a toothpick inserted into the middle of one of the center muffins comes out clean. \n \n \n Remove the muffins from the oven, loosen their edges from the pan, and after about 5 minutes transfer them to a rack to cool. \n \n \n Do the lemon zest /drizzle thing.  You know what I mean.  Yes you do! \n \n \n Yield: 12 muffins. \n \n \n Tips from our bakers \n \n \n Can you use coarse white sparkling sugar instead of granulated sugar on top of the muffins? Sure; but they won&#x27;t be &quot;true&quot; Jordan Marsh muffins. \n \n \n If you use frozen berries, don&#x27;t crush any of them. Rinse several times in cold water, then pat dry with paper towels before using; this will help prevent the muffins from baking up blue-green. \n \n \n Room-temperature butter is easier to work with than ice-cold butter when preparing muffin batter. If possible, remove butter from the fridge an hour or so before starting the recipe. \n \n Edit this page","hierarchy":{"lvl0":"Famous Department Store Gluten Free Blueberry Muffins","lvl1":null,"lvl2":null,"lvl3":null,"lvl4":null,"lvl5":null,"lvl6":null},"objectID":"1d529bfcb592b23a5550ef72b61f028a36df0970","type":"content","url":"https://danroscigno.github.io/Recipes/Famous_Department_Store_Gluten_Free_Blueberry_Muffins/","url_without_anchor":"https://danroscigno.github.io/Recipes/Famous_Department_Store_Gluten_Free_Blueberry_Muffins/"}

Place pecans on a small baking sheet in the oven for 6 to 8 minutes, or until they smell fragrant.

Serve in slices. \n Note:  Cake keeps for 5 to 6 days at room temperature. I leave it in the loaf pan, and just cover the cut side with foil.

(Alternatively, you can steam the squash.) Pat the squash dry and toss it into a large bowl. \n Add the remaining filling ingredients to the bowl and turn them gently with a large rubber spatula to blend. Let the filling sit for 5 minutes or so, just long enough to give the sugar time to melt, then gently mix again. \n Remove the pie plate and top crust from the refrigerator and put the pie plate on a baking sheet lined with parchment or a silicone mat. Spoon the filling into the bottom crust and level the top. Brush the rim of the bottom crust with a little water and center the rolled-out crust over the pie - if the top crust is too cold and not pliable, let it sit for a couple of minutes. Using your fingertips, press the top crust gently against the bottom. Either fold the overhang from the top crust under the bottom crust and crimp the crust attractively, or press the top crust against the bottom crust and trim the overhang from both crusts even with the rim of the pie plate. If you&#x27;ve pressed and trimmed the crust, use the tines of a fork to press the two crusts together. \n Using a small sharp knife, cut 4 slits in the top crust, and cut a circle out of the center of the crust using the wide end of a pastry tip. (If you have time, refrigerate the pie for about 30 minutes. The pie can also be wrapped airtight and frozen for up to 2 months; bake directly from the freezer, adding about 10 minutes to the baking time.) \n Brush the top of the pie lightly with water and dust with a little sugar. Bake the pie for 55 to 60 minutes, or until it is deeply golden and the filling is bubbling up through the center hole. Check the pie at 40 minutes - if it is already pretty brown, cover it loosely with a foil tent. Transfer the pie to a rack to cool to just warm or to room temperature. \n Serving:  This is a go-with-ice-cream pie. Try it with vanilla or cinnamon ice cream. \n Storing:  This pie is really best served the day it is made. If you must keep it overnight, store it covered in the refrigerator and bring it to room temperature or warm it for a few minutes in a 350-degree-F oven before serving. \n         Edit this page","hierarchy":{"lvl0":"Depths-of-Fall Butternut Squash Pie","lvl1":null,"lvl2":null,"lvl3":null,"lvl4":null,"lvl5":null,"lvl6":null},"objectID":"17931c5f6c0147061cc99a95ff5dd889388dc6f9","type":"content","url":"https://danroscigno.github.io/Recipes/Depths-of-Fall_Butternut_Squash_Pie/","url_without_anchor":"https://danroscigno.github.io/Recipes/Depths-of-Fall_Butternut_Squash_Pie/"}

Brine at least overnight and at most 24 hours, flipping the bag halfway through. \n Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F. \n Toss the piquante peppers, bell peppers and onions with the olive oil in a bowl.

Place a chop between plastic wrap and pound with a meat mallet until 1/2 inch thick. Make sure you pound around the bone but keep the bone intact; this adds flavor and plating dramatics. Repeat with the remaining chops. \n Set up an F. E. B. station with flour, egg and breadcrumbs in separate shallow containers; season the breadcrumbs with salt and pepper. Season each chop with salt and pepper, then dredge in the flour, coat with the egg and then coat in the breadcrumbs, ensuring the breadcrumbs adhere to all the nooks and crannies. \n Heat a large skillet over medium heat, add the vegetable oil and heat until very hot. Working in 2 batches, fry the chops 2 at a time until golden on each side, 4 to 5 minutes a side.

Slide dough in parchment onto a tray and chill until firm, about 15 minutes. \n Step 5 ​ \n Cut out as many cookies as possible with cookie cutter (chill dough again if necessary), reserving and chilling scraps. Transfer cookies to a parchment-lined large baking sheet, arranging them 1 inch apart. \n Step 6 ​ \n Bake until edges are golden-brown, 9 to 12 minutes. Cool on baking sheet 5 minutes, then slide cookies, still on parchment, onto a rack to cool completely. \n Step 7 ​ \n Make more cookies with remaining dough and scraps (reroll only once) on cooled freshly lined baking sheets. \n Step 8 ​ \n If icing cookies and coloring icing, transfer small batches to small bowls, 1 for each color, and tint with food coloring. Spoon each color of icing into separate sealable bags, pressing out excess air, and snip an 1/8-inch opening in 1 bottom corner of each bag. Pipe icing onto a plate to test consistency. If too thick, thin a small batch with a few drops of orange juice. \n Step 9 ​ \n Decoratively pipe icing onto cookies, then sprinkle with decorative sugar (if using) and let dry completely, about 1 hour (depending on humidity). \n Cook&#x27;s notes: \n ·  To make three-dimensional cookies, start with cut (but not baked) cookies on lined baking sheet. Make a 1 1/2-inch-long notch (1/3 inch wide) in each cookie, cutting toward center. If you want to make the cookies into ornaments, punch out a small hole (for string or ribbon to go through) on each side of notch on half of cookies using a piping tip with a 1/4-inch round opening. Bake and cool as directed. To make sure pairs of cookies fit, interlock cookies (one cookie with holes and one without) at notches to form sphere- or cube-like shapes. If necessary, carefully trim notches with a small sharp knife. If desired, ice unassembled cookies, avoiding middle portion near notch. Tie string or ribbon (if using) through holes of cookies and interlock. · Using a pastry bag fitted with a piping tip results in cleaner lines of icing. · Dough can be chilled up to 2 days. · Cookies (not interlocked) keep, layered between sheets of parchment if iced, in an airtight container at room temperature 1 week.

Spray a 24 cup mini muffin tin or 2 (12 cup) mini muffin tins with cooking spray. \n For the crust : In a food processor, combine the flour, sugar, salt and butter. Pulse the processor until the mixture resembles fine sand. Remove the lid and add the ice water to the mixture. Run the processor just until the mixture rolls itself into a little ball. If the mixture is a bit dry, add more ice water by the tablespoonful until it comes together. Gather the dough into a ball. With a bench scraper or knife, divide the mixture evenly in half. Shape each half into a disk. Wrap each disk in plastic wrap and chill at least 30 minutes. \n Cook&#x27;s Note:  At this point you can keep the wrapped dough in the refrigerator for a few days or freeze for later use. \n For the filling : In a saucepan, combine the pitted cherries and 1 cup water over medium-low heat for 10 minutes. In a small bowl, combine the sugar and cornstarch. Using a whisk, swirl the ingredients together, making sure that there aren&#x27;t any lumps in the cornstarch. Add the sugar-cornstarch mixture and lemon zest to the cherries. Cook the cherry mixture until it comes to a rolling boil. Cook 1 minute more, until thickened. Allow the cherry filling to cool slightly while you prepare the crust. \n Roll the dough disks out into 10-inch rounds on a well-floured work surface. With a 1 1/2-inch round cookie or biscuit cutter, edge lightly dipped in flour, cut 24 rounds from the first rolled out disk. With a 2-inch round cookie or biscuit cutter, edge lightly dipped in flour, cut 24 rounds from the second rolled out disk. You should have a total of 24 (1 1/2-inch) rounds and 24 (2-inch) rounds for matching top and bottom crusts. \n Gently fit the 2-inch dough rounds into the bottom of the prepared mini muffin tin. Make sure to pat down the bottom and the excess coming up the sides. Spoon about 1 heaping tablespoon cooled pie filling into each crust-lined cup. Fit the top of each mini pie with a 1 1/2-inch dough round, pushing down gently and sealing the bottom crust and top crust by crimping the edges together with a fork. With a sharp paring knife, make 3 small incisions on the top crust, to allow the steam to escape. \n Bake until the edges are golden brown and the filling is bubbly, about 12 minutes. Allow to cool on a wire rack, and then remove from the muffin tin. \n         Edit this page","hierarchy":{"lvl0":"Mini Cherry Pies with Homemade Cherry Filling","lvl1":null,"lvl2":null,"lvl3":null,"lvl4":null,"lvl5":null,"lvl6":null},"objectID":"0f1ba1906bbe1f0c17f9d3de7c8e5a07109d4042","type":"content","url":"https://danroscigno.github.io/Recipes/Mini_Cherry_Pies_with_Homemade_Cherry_Filling/","url_without_anchor":"https://danroscigno.github.io/Recipes/Mini_Cherry_Pies_with_Homemade_Cherry_Filling/"}

Cook over medium to medium-high heat to maintain a gentle bubbling, stirring frequently with a spatula, until the fruit has mostly broken down and turned almost jammy, about 20 minutes. Use the spatula to gently mash the fruit until fairly smooth. Cool slightly. \n Grind the freeze-dried peaches in a food processor to a fine powder; some larger pieces are okay. Add the cooked peaches and lemon juice; process to form a puree. Pass the puree through a fine-mesh strainer, pressing on the solids to extract as much liquid as possible. Discard the solids. You should have 3/4 to 1 cup strained puree. Cool completely. \n Whisk about 2 tablespoons of the milk with the cornstarch in a small bowl to form a smooth slurry. \n Whisk together the cream cheese and salt in a medium bowl until smooth. \n Combine the remaining milk, the cream, the remaining 3/4 cup sugar and the corn syrup in the saucepan, over medium-high heat. Bring to a rolling boil, reducing the heat as needed to make sure the mixture does not boil over; cook for 4 minutes. Remove from the heat just long enough to gradually whisk in the cornstarch slurry; return the mixture to a boil over medium-high heat and cook for about 1 minute, stirring with a spatula, until slightly thickened, with a consistency a little thicker than heavy cream. Remove from the heat. \n Gradually whisk the hot-milk mixture into the cream cheese, until smooth, then whisk in the strained peach puree.

Process until smooth. Transfer the pureed asparagus to a fine-mesh strainer set over a small bowl. Let the juices drain, 5 to 10 minutes, pressing down lightly on the puree with a wooden spoon occasionally. Reserve the juice and discard the pulp. \n Bring a large pot of generously salted water to a boil. \n Meanwhile, in a large bowl, whisk the ricotta, Parmesan and 1 tablespoon lemon juice with some salt and pepper. Add the lemon zest and set aside. \n Once the water has boiled, add the pasta and cook according to the package instructions until al dente. \n Meanwhile, add the olive oil to a large skillet over medium heat. Add the garlic and cook until lightly golden, about 2 minutes. Remove the garlic, then add the sliced asparagus and saute until tender, 3 to 5 minutes. Drain the pasta directly into the skillet with the asparagus. Add about half of the asparagus juice and allow to simmer for 1 minute. Add the remaining asparagus juice and the remaining tablespoon lemon juice and cook until the pasta is glossy, about 1 minute. Transfer to a bowl and garnish with Pecorino-Romano, lemon zest, dollops of the whipped ricotta, basil and black pepper. \n \n Cook’s Note ​ \n Fresh ricotta has a much more delicate flavor than most kinds with additives found in plastic tubs. You can find fresh ricotta in Italian markets or sometimes in supermarkets, mounded up high and packaged in small tin pails. It is often labeled as hand-dipped, hand-packed or hand-ladled. If you can&#x27;t find fresh ricotta in the tins, Calabro is a good brand found in plastic tubs.
