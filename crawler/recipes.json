Spray a 9-inch square baking pan with pan spray, line with parchment and spray the parchment. Set aside.\nPlace the diced apples in a single layer on a microwave-safe plate and cover with another plate. Microwave for 2 minutes, until the apples have softened and given off some liquid..*Transfer the apples to a paper towel-lined tray and set aside.\nIn a medium saucepan over medium-high heat, brown the butter until it is a deep golden color, 5 to 7 minutes. Immediately pour the hot butter into a medium heat-proof mixing bowl. *Add the cinnamon, clove, salt, baking powder and brown sugar. Whisk to combine. Whisk in the vanilla, whole egg and egg yolk until smooth. Add the all-purpose flour and stir with a rubber spatula until nearly combined. Add the reserved apple pieces and the nuts to the batter, saving about 2 tablespoons of each for topping the blondies. Stir the batter until the nuts and apples are evenly combined and then pour the batter into your prepared pan.

Much of the pectin is in the cores and flavor in the peels. Cut out damaged parts.\nQuarter the apples:\nCook the apples:\n\nPut the quartered apples into large pot, add the vinegar and water, cover, bring to a boil, reduce heat to simmer, cook until apples are soft, about 20 minutes. Remove from heat.\n\nPush the apples through a food mill:\n\nLadle apple mixture (cooked apples and liquid) into a chinois sieve (or food mill) and using a pestle force pulp from the chinois into a large bowl below.\n\nAdd sugar, spices, lemon zest, and juice:\n\nMeasure resulting apple pulp. Add 1/3 to 1/2 cup of sugar for each cup of apple pulp. Stir to dissolve sugar. Add cinnamon, ground cloves, allspice, lemon zest, lemon juice, and a pinch of salt. Taste and adjust seasonings if necessary.\n\nCook the apple mixture and stir often:\n\nCook the apple sugar mixture uncovered in a large, wide, thick-bottomed pot on medium low heat, stirring often to prevent burning. Scrape the bottom of the pot while you stir to make sure a crust is not forming at the bottom.\n\n\nCook until thick, smooth, and dark brown in color (about 1 to 2 hours). A small bit spooned onto a chilled (in the freezer) plate will be thick, not runny.\n\n\nYou can also cook the puree on low heat, stirring only occasionally, but this will take much longer as stirring encourages evaporation. (Note the wider the pan the better, as there is more surface for evaporation.)\n\n\nIf you went with the lower amount of sugar, taste the apple butter and add a little more sugar if you think it needs it.\n\n\nNote: Try giving this apple butter a day two to age before you enjoy it. On the day it's made, it can taste quite sharp. After a few days, it mellows out and the flavors meld.\nHow To Can the Apple Butter​\n\n\nMidway through cooking the apple butter down, place a steamer rack in a large stockpot, and place 6 to 8 (8-ounce) canning jars on the rack. Fill the jars and the pot with water up to the rim of the jars.\nBring to a boil and reduce to a simmer.\nWash the lids in hot, soapy water.\n\n(Because the jars will be processed in a water bath for 10 minutes, you do not need to sterilize the jars. They do, however, need to be warm.)\nPrep the canning jars:\n\n\nRemove the jars from the water bath using jar lifters. Fill the hot jars with the hot apple butter, leaving 1/4 inch headspace. Screw on the lids so they are fingertip tight.\nLower the jars into the boiling water bath. If needed, add enough water to cover the tops of the jars with at least 1 inch of water. When the water returns to a boil, process in the water bath for 10 minutes.\nRemove the jars from the water bath and set on a clean dishtowel. As the jars cool, you should hear the lids \"popping\" as they seal the jars.\nPour the apple butter into hot jars and seal:\n\nEdit this page",

Drain on paper towels. Finely chop and set aside.\nSifte the dry ingredients together into a large bowl. Stir well. Cut the butter and shortening into small pieces and add to flour mixture. Using a pastry cutter, crumble the fats into the flour mixture until the fats are pea-sized and the mixture resembles cornmeal. Add the bacon and chives. Add the milk and mix the dough until it just comes together, making sure not to overmix.\nKnead the dough gently on a lightly floured work surface. Roll out the dough to 1/2” thickness. Be sure it is 1/2” thickness or biscuits will be too dry and if too think they won’t cook completely. Using a 2” cutter, cut out the biscuits and on an ungreased cookie sheet. The biscuits can be made several hours ahead of time; cover and refrigerate.\nBake for 14-15 minutes, or until the biscuits begin to turn a pale shade of golden brown. If the biscuits come straight out of the refrigerator they will need to bake for closer to 19-20 minutes. Serve warm or at room temp.Edit this page",

Bring to a boil, then reduce to a simmer, cover, and cook for 25 minutes.\nAfter 25 minutes, add quinoa, stir to combine with the brown rice, cover, and continue to cook on low-medium heat for 15 minutes or until cooked and can be fluffed with a fork.\nWhile the grain mixture is cooking, prepare the chicken. Place the chicken breasts on a cutting board and season them generously with salt and pepper on both sides.\nIn a grill pan or cast-iron skillet on medium-high heat, warm the olive oil, then add the seasoned chicken and cook for 5-6 minutes per side until cooked through or they reach an internal temperature of 165°F. Once cooked, remove them from the pan and set aside for at least 5 minutes before slicing them into thin strips or cubes.\nWhile the chicken is cooking, prepare the black bean and corn salsa. In a medium bowl, add the olive oil, lime juice, garlic powder, paprika, ground cumin, and a pinch of salt and whisk until well combined. Add the strained and rinsed black beans and corn and toss until well coated in the dressing. Taste and adjust seasoning with salt and pepper as needed.\nOnce the grain mixture and chicken are ready, assemble the bowls. Split the cooked quinoa and rice mixture evenly across four bowls, then top with grilled chicken, black bean and corn salsa, tomatoes, avocado, a dollop of Greek yogurt, a drizzle of salsa verde, a sprinkle of chopped cilantro, and a wedge of lime.\nThese bowls can be served immediately or stored in the fridge for up to 4 days.

        "Content": "Banana Peel Cake with Brown Sugar FrostingOn this pageBanana Peel Cake with Brown Sugar Frosting\nDesserts Picnic Fare\nFrom Cooking with Scraps\" by Lindsay-Jean Hard \nMakes one 2 layer 8” cake\nIngredients:​\nFor the cake:​\nPeels from 2 very ripe bananas, stem and very bottom discarded (see note)\n1/2 cup unsalted butter, softened, plus more for buttering the pans \n1 1/2 cups granulated sugar \n2 large eggs, separated \n1/2 cup buttermilk \n1 2/3 cups cake flour, plus more (any type) for flouring the pans \n1 teaspoon baking soda \n1/4 teaspoon baking powder \n1/2 teaspoon fine-grain sea salt \nFor the frosting:​\n1/2 cup unsalted butter\n1 cup packed light or dark brown sugar \n1/4 cup milk, 2 percent or higher \n1 3/4 to 2 cups powdered sugar, sifted \nDirections:​\n\nHeat the oven to 350 degrees F.\nTo make the cake: Cut the banana peels into 1-inch pieces and place them in a small saucepan with 1 cup of water. Bring to a boil over medium-high heat, then reduce the heat and simmer for 10 minutes. Remove the pan from the heat and allow the mixture to cool slightly, then drain the banana peels, reserving 1/4 cup of the cooking water.\nMeanwhile, butter and flour the sides of two 8-inch round cake pans and line the bottoms with parchment paper. Butter and flour the pans again to coat the paper.\nTransfer the peels and the 1/4 cup of cooking water to a tall, narrow container and puree with an immersion blender until completely smooth (a mini food processor would do the trick, too!).\nCream together the butter and sugar in a large bowl using an electric mixer (or a wooden spoon for an arm workout) until pale and fluffy, 3 to 5 minutes. Add the egg yolks one at a time, mixing until incorporated, and scraping down the sides of the bowl after each addition. Mix in the banana peel mixture, then stir in the buttermilk until well-combined.\nIn a medium-size bowl, whisk together the flour, baking soda, baking powder, and salt. Add the dry ingredients to the bowl with the butter mixture and stir gently, just until combined.\nPut the egg whites in another bowl (make sure it's clean and dry!) and whisk until soft peaks form -- either by hand or with the whisk attachment on an electric mixer. If using an electric mixer, start slowly and gradually increase speed to medium-high. You're done when you pull out the whisk or beater and a soft peak is formed, but immediately collapses. Gently fold the egg whites into the batter and divide the batter evenly between the two prepared pans.\nBake, rotating the pans halfway through, until the tops are golden and a toothpick inserted into the center of each cake pulls out with dry crumbs rather than wet batter, about 25 minutes. Let the cakes cool completely in the pans.\nWhen the cakes are completely cool and you're ready to assemble, make the frosting: Melt the butter in a medium saucepan over low heat. Stir in the brown sugar and cook, stirring constantly, for 2 minutes. Stir in the milk, raise the heat to medium-high and cook, stirring constantly until the mixture boils. Remove from the heat and let cool to lukewarm. Gradually whisk in 1 3/4 cups powdered sugar, beating until smooth. Add the additional 1/4 cup powdered sugar if the frosting is too loose. Use the frosting immediately, as it will begin to thicken and stiffen as it sits.\nTo remove the cake from the pans, invert one cake pan on a serving plate, lift pan, and peel the parchment. Repeat for the second cake pan. Put one layer of the cake on a serving platter and spread about one-third of the frosting evenly over the top. Set the other layer on top, and spread the remaining frosting over the top and sides of the cake.\n\n*Cook’s Note:​\nIf you have time to plan ahead, you can skip the step of cooking the banana peels, by freezing and thawing them to soften them. Remove the stem and very bottom of the banana peels, then cut the peels into 1-inch pieces and freeze in an airtight container in the freezer until you're ready to bake the cake. Thaw the peels, either in the refrigerator or the counter, depending on your timeline, and puree the peels as directed in step 4, adding up to 1/4 cup of water if needed. The peels will be nearly black, and thus the puree will not be pretty, but the final cake will be just as delicious.

Place nuts on a baking sheet. Bake until fragrant and toasted, about 12 minutes. Transfer to a clean kitchen towel; rub to loosen skins. Butter a 9-by-3-inch springform pan well; coat with cocoa, tapping out any excess.\nStep 1\nIn a food processor, grind nuts with granulated sugar until fine but not pasty; transfer to a large bowl; stir in the flour, baking soda, and salt.\nStep 2\nIn a heat-proof bowl, whisk together cocoa and boiling water until smooth. (Mixture will thicken as it cools.)\nStep 3\nIn the bowl of an electric mixer, cream butter and brown sugar on high until lightened and fluffy, 3 to 4 minutes. Beat in eggs one at a time until well blended.\nStep 4\nStir buttermilk and vanilla into cocoa mixture. Mixing on low, add half of dry ingredients to creamed mixture; when blended, pour in the cocoa mixture, and add remaining dry mixture, mixing just until incorporated. Scrape batter into prepared pan, smooth top. Bake 1 hour to 1 hour and 10 minutes, until a tester inserted in the center comes out clean. Let cool in pan for 10 minutes; remove from pan and cool completely. Place cooled cake on a 9-inch cardboard round.\nStep 5\nPlace half the ganache in a bowl; place in a larger bowl of ice water; whip with a balloon whisk until lighter in color and spreadable, removing bowl from ice bath and returning it as necessary.\nStep 6\nSpread the whipped ganache smoothly on top and sides of cooled cake, and chill the cake. Gently stir remaining ganache every 5 minutes until thickened and cool.\nStep 7\nPlace cake (still on cardboard round) on a wire rack over a sheet of waxed or parchment paper. Working with a small ladle, pour ganache over top of cake, moving the ladle in a circular fashion while in contact with the cake, letting the ganache run down sides. Scrape up excess and reserve for another use. Let cake stand at room temperature until set. Garnish with nuts and chocolate curls.\nStep 8\n\nGanache:\n\nChop chocolate finely using a serrated knife; place in a large heat-proof bowl.\nStep 1\nBring cream to a boil over medium-high heat; pour directly over chopped chocolate. Allow to sit 10 minutes. Use a rubber spatula to gently stir chocolate and cream until well combined and smooth. Let sit at room temperature until cooled and just thickened, stirring occasionally, about 30 minutes, but up to an hour depending on the temperature of the room.\nStep 2\n\nCandied Nuts and Curls:\n\nStep 1\n\nPreheat oven to 350 degrees. Place nuts on a baking sheet. Bake until fragrant and toasted, about 12 minutes. Transfer to a clean kitchen towel; rub to loosen skins. Place sugar and water in a medium heavy skillet. Stir with a fork over medium-high heat until dissolved; let boil undisturbed for 3 minutes. Add nuts to pan; stir with wooden spoon until caramel seizes around nuts. Transfer to parchment-lined shallow baking sheet; let cool.\n\nOnce nuts are cool, place half of chopped chocolate in a deep medium-size stainless-steel bowl. Place bowl over a saucepan with 1 inch of simmering water; stir until chocolate is melted and hot. Add remaining chocolate to bowl, remove bowl from pan of water, let stand about 5 minutes, then stir until smooth.\nStep 2\nPour half the chocolate onto an inverted baking sheet; spread with a bench scraper until 1/8 inch thick or slightly thinner (chocolate should be opaque on surface). Let stand until just tacky. Hold scraper at a 45Âº angle; scrape chocolate off surface. Store curls at room temperature in an airtight container layered with parchment.\nStep 3\nWhile chocolate sets, add candied nuts to remaining chocolate in bowl, and stir until coated. Spread nuts on a parchment lined baking sheet, and let stand until set.\nStep 4\nSift cocoa powder on top of dried nuts and toss to coat. Store in a resealable plastic bag for up to 1 week, until ready to use.\nStep 5\n\n*Cook's Notes:​\nToast and peel the nuts for the cake and garnish at the same time. Bake the cake up to three days ahead; wrap well and keep at room temperature. The candied hazelnuts and chocolate curls can also be made three days ahead; store in airtight containers.Edit this page",

Cook the poblanos until totally charred all over, turning as needed, about 2 minutes per side. Transfer to a small bowl and cover with plastic wrap so the poblanos can steam. After 10 minutes, use your fingers to pull the blackened skins away from the poblanos, then remove the stems and seeds. Roughly chop the poblanos and set aside.\nStep 2\nWhile the poblano chiles steam, place a large skillet over medium heat. Working in batches to cook the guajillo chiles evenly in one layer, flatten the chile halves on the hot skillet and toast them for about 15 seconds, turning once. Put the chiles in a bowl and add 2 cups hot water to help soften them. Set aside.\nStep 3\nPrepare the meat: Season the meat all over with the salt. Heat the oil in a large, oven-proof pot over medium-high. Working in batches, sear the meat on all sides until well browned, 2 to 3 minutes per side, transferring the browned meat to a large bowl as you work.\nStep 4\nAfter you’ve seared all the meat, add the onion to the pot and cook, stirring occasionally, until golden, about 5 minutes.

Set aside.\nCombine the sugar and the lemon and orange zest in a small bowl and rub the zests into the sugar with your fingers to infuse the sugar. Set aside.\nIn a stand mixer fitted with a whisk attachment, beat the softened butter and oil together until they become homogenous, about 3 minutes. This will not work if your butter is not completely room temperature.\nSlowly add the granulated sugar to the oil and butter, beating on high until the mixture is light and fluffy and turns a very pale yellow, about 3 minutes.\nAdd the eggs in one at time, scraping down the bowl in between each addition. Add the lemon extract and the vanilla extract. Beat the mixture on high for 3 minutes more to incorporate as much air as possible.\nIn separate bowl sift together the cake flour, salt, and baking powder. Alternate mixing in the dry ingredients and the buttermilk in 4 batches, starting with the buttermilk and ending with the dry ingredients. It’s okay if the batter still has a few lumps in it–you don’t want to over mix it. Fold in blueberries until just mixed. Pour into two greased and floured 9-in. round baking pans.\nSplit the batter evenly into the prepared pans and bake for 30 minutes or until the cake is a lightly golden brown and springs back when pressed. This will depend on your oven. Take out of the oven and transfer to a cooling rack. Let the cakes cool completely.\nIf making dehydrated lemons, use a sharp knife to thinly slice 2 lemons. Preheat the oven to 300°F and line two sheet pans with parchment paper. Place the lemon slices a few inches apart on the prepared pans and sprinkle with granulated sugar. Bake until dry to the touch, about 2 hours. Allow the lemon slices to cool, then store in an airtight container at room temperature. until ready to use.\nWhile the cakes cool, make the frosting. Beat the butter and cream cheese together until combined. Scrape down the bowl and add the powdered sugar, 1 Tablespoon of the milk, vanilla extract, lemon extract and salt. Beat until light and fluffy, about two minutes. If the frosting is too thick, add in a Tablespoon of milk at a time until desired consistency.\nPlace first cake on a cake stand, then top with generous amount of frosting. Layer second and third layers, frosting the same amount in between each. Frost edges of cake with remaining frosting. If making a naked cake, use an offset spatula to scrape off any excess frosting. If using the dried lemon slices, gently press the lemon slices along the outside of the cake, layering them slightly over one another.\nEdit this page",

Butternut and acorn squash work, too. The peel of\nwinter squash is fully edible, so no need to trim it away.\nThis is my favorite way to cook winter squash. It takes a cue from\nTfondant, or melting, potatoes, a technique in which thick slices of\npotato are roasted on both sides before they finish cooking braised in a\npuddle of broth. From the oven, they're crisp and somewhat glazed out-\nside, creamy inside, and booming with more flavor than it seems possible\nto lock inside a potato. Clearly, I'm a fan—but I had no idea that when I\napplied this technique to big wedges of winter squash I'd never want to\ncook it another way again.\nI add to the pan everything I like with winter squash—thyme, garlic,\nand cider vinegar, which gets sweet/tangy when cooked and really helps\ncut through the sweetness of squash —and then I put the whole thing on a\nplate of tart yogurt and peppery baby arugula. Any slightly syrupy broth\nleft in the pan is poured over everything, and it's all so good together, you\nmight wonder why you'd ever consider squash a side dish again. This is\ncenterpiece squash, and it wants you to know it.\nHeat the oven to 425°F (220°C).\nCut the squash in half and scoop out the seeds and pulp, then slice\nthe halves into 1-1/2-inch wedges. Add butter and 1 tablespoon of the oil\nto a 10-by-15-inch baking sheet, and place in the oven until the butter\nmelts, about 2 minutes. Remove the tray from the oven, and roll the but-\nter around so that it evenly coats the pan. Arrange the squash wedges in\none layer, and sprinkle with thyme, 1/2 teaspoon salt, and lots of freshly\nground black pepper. Roast for 15 minutes, or until deeply browned under-\nneath. Flip the slices, and season the second side on top with another\n1/2 teaspoon salt and more pepper. Scatter the garlic cloves in the pan,\nand return the pan to the oven to roast for another 12 to 15 minutes, until\nthe wedges are browned on the second side. Don't worry if the squash\nisn't fully cooked yet. Carefully pour the broth and vinegar into the pan,\nand roast for another 10 to 15 minutes, until the squash is tender and the\nliquid is somewhat cooked off\nTo serve the squash: Use the back of a spoon to swirl plain yogurt onto a serving platter into a thin layer. Toss the arugula with the remaining tablespoon olive oil and a pinch of salt and pepper, and scatter over the yogurt. Arrange the squash wedges on top, scrape out every bit of pan juice that's left, and pour it over the squash.Edit this page",

        "Content": "TEXAS BRISKET - ON AN OFFSET SMOKEROn this pageTEXAS BRISKET - ON AN OFFSET SMOKER\nAuthor is Meat Church 19 MAY, 2021\nI edited this to use the Texas A and M rub instead of the ones that Meat Church uses because I have some on hand. In the video the author suggests using the commercial bubs or just salt and pepper and maybe garlic.\nThis is the recipe you come to Meat Church seeking. Texas brisket on an offset smoker. The Texas BBQ cooked the old school way by a Texan. Wood, fire \u0026 meat. No shortcuts, no electronics, no gimmicks. Just patience. And maybe a fair amount of cold beer....\nThere are a lot of ways to smoke briskets. In fact you have probably seen my 275 method which I typically use for a standard sized brisket that I need to get cooked in under 10 hours. However, this recipe is a very traditional Texas style and recipe that is going to take more hours to smoke and will yield and even better brisket.\nThis process can be replicated as a pellet smoker or kamado style grill (indirect) brisket as well.\n\nMeat Church Cook How To YouTube Video: https://youtu.be/Mgy7ou8bFRQ\nMeat Church Brisket Trim YouTube Video: https://youtu.be/MTc5VAgZKLE\n\nIngredients​\n\n1 Full packer brisket. Choice grade or higher. (I used the Angus from Sam's Club, around 12 pounds.)\nTexas A and M brisket rub\n\nTools​\n\nInstant Read Thermometer\nUnwaxed butcher paper (sub heavy duty aluminum foil)\n\nPrepare your smoker​\nPrepare your smoker at 225 degrees with post oak. Other good alternatives would be mesquite, hickory or pecan. I prefer \"heavy smoke\" woods for this cook. Optionally you can place a pan of water in your smoker for additional moisture should you feel your smoker needs it.\n\nNote: My smoker is happy around 240 measured at the grill on the far side. The thermometer in the lid reads 280 when the grill is at 240.\nWhen the fire starts in the the firebox there will be alot of smoke, let the smoke fade to a shimmer before closing the door to the firebox and closing the vent on the grill down low. Thick smoke tastes bad.\n\nTrim the brisket​\nTrim hard and excess fat off the meat side of the brisket. Also, remove any “hard” pieces of fat as they will not render off during the cooking process. Trim the fat off the fat side of the brisket only leaving ¼ in fat. My brisket trim video will help guide you.\nPrepare the brisket​\nSeason the rub. I typically slather with mustard as a binder. Oil, mustard, pickle juice are commonly used binders should you choose to use one.\n\nNote: I used mayo once as a binder and it was good, I also used no binder and it was good. I think going forward no binder maybe.\n\nAllow the seasoning to adhere for 15 - 20 minutes. Flip the brisket over to the fat side. Repeat the seasoning process. Season the sides as well. Allow it to adhere for 30 minutes if time allows.\n\nNote: I apply the rub the night before and let it sit for 20 minutes on the meat side before flipping.\n\nSmoke the brisket​\nSmoking fat side up vs meat side up is one of the hottest debates in BBQ! As we mentioned in the beginning, we are smoking this brisket the traditional Texas BBQ joint way. Place the brisket in the smoker fat-side up with the point (fatty side) of the brisket nearest the fire box.\nLeave the brisket untouched as that beautiful bark develops. Optionally you can spritz a time or two with cider vinegar or water if the brisket appears to dry out. I do not think this is needed with a fat side up brisket. That is more commonly needed when cooking a meat side up brisket.\nWhen the meat reaches an internal temperature of at least 175 (the bark will be set nicely by this point) it is time to wrap.\n\nNote: Around four hours in I move the temperature probe from the grill into the meat. When the internal temp is at least 175 I will wrap the brisket in butcher paper. The temp might be around 160 degrees in the thickest part of the brisket at 4 hours.\n\nWrapping in butcher paper will allow you to maintain your bark. Wrap the brisket in non-waxed butcher paper. Depending on the size of your brisket this could be 6 - 8 hours into the cook. However, the time is no the most important thing to be worried about. Focus on the visual look of the bark and the internal temp. I like to spritz the inside of the paper with liquid to make the paper more more pliable before I lay the brisket on it to wrap. Our brisket cook video illustrates this process. Alternatively, wrapping in aluminum foil is a bit easier to master and will deliver a juicy, delicious brisket.\nFinishing the brisket and resting​\nContinue to smoke the brisket until the meat is “probe tender” in the thick part of the flat. This means when you probe it in the flat (not the point) there is no resistance. Think of sticking a toothpick in a cake. Each piece of meat is different but this will likely be around an internal temperature of 203°F. Wagyu briskets often need to be cooked to a higher internal temp close to 210 internal.\n\nNote: The 12 pound brisket I cooked was probe tender and 203 - 205 degrees at nine hours after cooking at about 240-ish degrees and being wrapped at 175 degrees. I left it wrapped in a dry cooler until it was time to eat (around two and a half hours).\n\nRemove the brisket from the smoker, and rest it still wrapped at ambient temperature on the counter for an hour. Resting at room\\ambient temp will stop the cooking process and allow the juices in the brisket to redistribute. It will be the perfect temp to slice and eat in an hour.\nIf you need to hold the meat longer then rest it on the counter for 15 minutes and then place it in a cooler. An insulated cooler can hot hold a brisket safely for hours.\nUnwrap the brisket, slice only what you plan to eat and enjoy!Edit this page",

        "Content": "Brown Butter Cake with Spiced Chocolate Ganache and Dulce de LecheOn this pageBrown Butter Cake with Spiced Chocolate Ganache and Dulce de Leche\nDesserts Want to make\nMakes 10-12 servings\nIngredients:\nBrown Butter Cake:\n2 sticks unsalted butter, plus 1 tablespoon (or nonstick cooking spray) for greasing the pans\n3 3/4 cups all-purpose flour, plus more for flouring the pans \n1 tablespoon baking powder \n1 teaspoon ground cinnamon \n1/2 teaspoon freshly grated nutmeg \n1/2 teaspoon baking soda \n1 1/2 teaspoons kosher salt \n1 packed cup light brown sugar \n1 cup granulated sugar \n3 large eggs, at room temperature \n1/2 cup sour cream \n2 teaspoons vanilla extract \n1 1/2 cups whole milk\nAssembly:\n2 cups of your favorite vanilla frosting\n3/4 cup dulce de leche \n1/2 teaspoon flaky sea salt \nSpiced Chocolate Ganache, recipe follows\nSpiced Chocolate Ganache:\n1/2 cup chopped bittersweet chocolate\n1/2 cup heavy cream \n1/2 teaspoon ground cinnamon \n1/2 teaspoon vanilla extract \n1/4 teaspoon chili powder \nDirections:\nSpecial equipment:\nthree 8-inch cake pans\n\nFor the cake: Melt the butter in a large shallow saucepan over medium-low heat. Cook, stirring occasionally, until the butter starts to brown and smell nutty, 10 to 12 minutes. Scrape the butter and all the browned bits into a heatproof bowl. Place the bowl over an ice bath to solidify and set aside.\nPreheat the oven to 350 degrees F. Grease three 8-inch cake pans with the 1 tablespoon butter (or spray with nonstick cooking spray) and then lightly dust with flour.\nWhisk together the 3 3/4 cups flour, baking powder, cinnamon, nutmeg, baking soda and salt in a medium bowl until well combined, then set the flour mixture aside.\nWhen the brown butter has solidified, scrape it into the bowl of a stand mixer fitted with the paddle attachment. Add the brown sugar and granulated sugar and beat on high speed until very light and fluffy, about 3 minutes. Scrape down the bowl and reduce the speed to medium, then add the eggs one at a time, beating after each addition and scraping the bottom of the bowl to be sure everything is well mixed.\nAdd the sour cream and vanilla and beat just until well mixed, scraping down the bowl again. Add the flour mixture in three parts, alternating with the milk, beating just until incorporated. Remove the bowl from the mixer and give the batter a couple of folds with a spatula, scraping the bottom to ensure everything is evenly mixed.\nDivide the batter among the three prepared cake pans and bake until golden brown and a toothpick inserted in the center comes out mostly clean with some moist crumbs sticking to it, about 25 minutes. Place the pans on a wire rack until cool enough to handle, then invert them onto the rack and unmold the cakes. Carefully turn the cakes right-side up and let cool completely on the rack.\nFor the assembly: Look at your cake layers. If any of them have a dome in the center, cut it off with a serrated knife so the entire top is flat. Place one cake layer on a cake plate or cardboard cake round. Spread vanilla frosting around the outside of one layer and then frost a 1-inch band around the top. Evenly spread half the dulce de leche in the center of the layer until you reach the 1-inch band and then sprinkle with half the sea salt. Add another cake layer and repeat with the frosting and remaining dulce de leche and sea salt. Add the last cake layer and frost the entire cake with a smooth and even layer of frosting. Refrigerate for about 30 minutes until the frosting is set and cold.\nRemove the cake from the refrigerator and place it on a serving plate or cake stand. Using a spoon, create drips with ganache around the outside of the cake from the top edge. Pour the remaining ganache in the center of the cake and spread it with an offset spatula to cover the top. Let the ganache set completely before serving.\n\nSpiced Chocolate Ganache:​\nYield: 3/4 cup\n\nPlace the chocolate in a heatproof bowl. Stir together the cream, cinnamon, vanilla and chili powder in a small saucepan. Heat over medium heat until it just begins to bubble around the edges, then pour it over the chocolate and let sit for about 10 seconds. Stir until smooth and shiny. Let the ganache sit until it has cooled and thickened slightly, about 5 minutes.\nEdit this page",

Add cold water to cover by 2 inches (about 5 quarts). Bring to a boil, then reduce to a simmer. Simmer, uncovered, until the chicken is very tender, for at least 1 1/2 hours (or up to 2 hours if you have the time. The longer the better!) Add more water, as needed, skimming off scum (there won’t be much) and, if desired, some fat.\nCarefully strain the stock, discarding everything except for the chicken. (You should have 3 1/2 to 4 1/2 quarts of stock.) Set the chicken aside to cool briefly while you put together the rest of the soup. Return the strained stock to the pot and bring it to a simmer. Add the sliced carrot, sliced celery, chopped onion, sliced parsnip, chopped dill, chopped parsley and the salt. Bring to a boil and reduce to a simmer. Simmer, covered, for 20 minutes.\nMeanwhile, prepare the dumplings: In a small saucepan, bring the butter and 3/4 cup water to a boil. Remove from the heat and stir in the flour. Let cool for a few minutes so it’s not so hot that it will cook the eggs, then whisk in the salt, sugar, nutmeg and the eggs, one at a time, until incorporated into a slightly lumpy thick batter. (It’ll take a little work to whisk in the eggs.)\nDrop heaping teaspoons of the dumpling mixture into the simmering soup, then cover and cook until the vegetables are tender and the dumplings are cooked through; begin checking for doneness at 15 minutes.\nPull the chicken meat off the bones and chop into bite-sized pieces. Season it with salt, then add it to the soup along with the ground black pepper. Taste and add more salt as needed. This is important: The amount of salt in a chicken soup can mean the difference between unappetizing chicken tea and the elixir of bubble love that it should be. So don’t skip this step, and don’t rush it, either. Taste your soup, and if it doesn’t make you smile reflexively, add more salt, about a 1/2 teaspoon of it, and give it a few good stirs so it can dissolve. Taste and repeat, as needed, until it tastes good.\nServe, garnishing with fresh parsley.\nEdit this page",

Cook the mixture over a low heat until thickened, 3 to 4 minutes. Remove from the heat.\nIn a medium bowl, combine the egg yolks and add about 1/4 cup of the cooked flour and milk mixture. Whisk to combine to temper the egg yolks. Stir the chocolate into the remaining flour and milk mixture and mix until the chocolate is melted and well combined. Add the chocolate mixture to the tempered egg yolks and mix to combine and fully incorporate.\nSoak a paper towel in the vinegar and wipe out the bowl of a stand mixer. Add the egg whites to the bowl and fit the stand mixer with a whisk attachment. Beat the whites on medium-high speed, slowly adding the remaining 3 tablespoons granulated sugar, 1 tablespoon at a time, and continuing to beat until you have stiff, glossy peaks, about 5 minutes.\nFold half of the egg white mixture into the chocolate base, followed by the remaining. (A few streaks of egg white is fine to remain, so as to not overmix.) Divide the mixture into the buttered and sugared ramekins, filling about three-quarters of the way. Gently tap the ramekins once on the sheet pan to evenly distribute the filling. Run your thumb around the rims of the ramekins to level and clean the edges. Bake, turning halfway through, until the edges are set but the centers are jiggly, about 18 minutes. Remove from the oven and place each ramekin on a plate. Garnish with a dusting of powdered sugar. Create a pocket in the center of each souffle to pour in the Creme Anglaise, if using. Enjoy warm.\n\nCreme Anglaise:\n\nIn a medium pot, whisk together the heavy cream, milk, sugar, salt, egg yolks and vanilla seeds. Place the pot over low heat and cook, stirring constantly, until it thickens and coats the back of a spoon.\nFill a large bowl with ice. Place a smaller bowl on top of the ice. Strain the anglaise into the smaller bowl and let cool completely.\nEdit this page",

        "Content": "Chile VerdeOn this pageChile Verde\nMain Meal Mexican/Cuban/Latin Inspired\nINGREDIENTS​\n\n1 1/2 pounds tomatillos\n5 garlic cloves, not peeled\n2 jalapeños, seeds and ribs removed, chopped\n2 Anaheim or Poblano chiles (optional)\n1 bunch cilantro leaves, cleaned and chopped\n3 1/2 to 4 pounds pork shoulder (also called pork butt), trimmed of excess fat and cut into 1 to 2-inch cubes\nSalt\nFreshly ground black pepper\nExtra virgin olive oil\n2 yellow onions, chopped\n3 garlic cloves, peeled and finely chopped\n2 tablespoons of chopped fresh oregano or 1 Tbsp of dried oregano\n2 1/2 cups chicken stock\nPinch of ground cloves\n\nDIRECTIONS:​\n1 Roast the tomatillos, garlic:��Remove papery husks from tomatillos and rinse well.\nCut in half and place cut side down, along with 5 unpeeled garlic cloves, on a foil-lined baking sheet. Place under a broiler for about 5-7 minutes to lightly blacken the skin. Remove from oven, let cool enough to handle.\nIf you want the additional flavor of chilies other than jalapenos, you can add a couple Anaheim or poblano chiles. Either use canned green chiles or roast fresh chilies over a gas flame or under the broiler until blackened all around. Let cool in a bag, remove the skin, seeds, and stem.\n2 Purée tomatillos with garlic, jalapeño, cilantro:��Place tomatillos, skins included, into blender. Remove the now roasted garlic cloves from their skins, add them to the blender. Add chopped Jalapeño peppers, other chilies (if you are using them), and cilantro to the blender. Pulse until all ingredients are finely chopped and mixed.\n3 Sear pork on all sides:��Season the pork cubes generously with salt and pepper. Heat olive oil in a large, heavy-bottomed skillet over medium high heat and brown pork chunks well on all sides.\nWork in batches so that the pork is not crowded in the pan and has a better chance to brown well. Using a slotted spoon or tongs, lift pork out of pan and place in bowl, set aside.\n4 Sauté onions and garlic:��Pour off excess fat, anything beyond a tablespoon, and place the onions and garlic in the same skillet and cook, stirring occasionally until limp, about 5 minutes.\n5 Add pork, oregano, tomatillo sauce, stock, ground cloves:��If your skillet is large enough to cook the entire batch of chile verde, with the sauce and meat, then add the pork back to the pan. If not, get a large soup pot and add the onion mixture and the pork to it. Add the oregano to the pan.\nAdd the tomatillo chile verde sauce to the pork and onions. Add the chicken stock (enough to cover the meat). Add a pinch of ground cloves. Add a little salt and pepper. (Not too much as the chile verde will continue to cook down and concentrate a bit.)\n6 Simmer 2-3 hours:��Bring to a boil and reduce to a slight simmer. Cook for 2-3 hours uncovered or until the pork is fork tender.\nAdjust the seasoning to taste with salt and pepper. Serve with Spanish rice and warmed flour tortillas or freshly made corn tortillas.Edit this page",

Reduce the heat to a simmer and cook, covered, for 12-15 minutes until all the liquid is absorbed and the rice is tender.\nStep 2: Allow it to rest​\nJasmine rice is notorious for sticking to the bottom of the saucepan, so we let the rice sit for 5 to 10 minutes before stirring. It takes a bit of patience and self-control, but it’ll be worth it when you have soft, fluffy grains!\nStep 3: Fluff it up​\nIt’s time to add your seasonings. Add the remaining ingredients to the rice and fluff the mixture with a fork. The lime juice and fresh cilantro are obvious, but the pinch of ground nutmeg is our second secret ingredient. This warming spice will seep into the grains, adding a slightly spicy aroma while also bringing out the rich flavor of the rice and enhancing the bright lime and herbaceous cilantro flavors.

        "Content": "Creamy Tomato Chickpea MasalaCreamy Tomato Chickpea Masala\nMain Meal Want to make Kim Acceptable Indian Inspired\nServes 4\n3 tablespoons (45 grams) neutral oil, butter, or ghee\n1 large yellow onion, minced\n2-inch piece ginger, peeled, and minced or grated\n2 garlic cloves, minced or grated\nKosher salt\n1 teaspoon ground cumin\n1 teaspoon ground turmeric\n1/2 teaspoon garam masala\n1 teaspoon ground coriander\n1/2 to 1 teaspoon ground cayenne or mild chili powder\n2 tablespoons (35 grams) tomato paste\nOne 14.5-ounce can (410 grams) diced or crushed tomatoes, or 1-3/4 cups small-diced fresh tomatoes\n3-1/2 cups (two 15.5-ounce or 440-gram cans) cooked chickpeas, drained, rinsed (see note)\n2 to 4 tablespoons (30 to 60 grams) heavy cream\nHandful of roughly chopped fresh parsley or cilantro (optional)\nrice for serving\nI grew up in an area of New Jersey with a large South Asian population.\nThough I know my affinities for cumin, coriander, turmeric, and gin-\nger were planted by the incredible aromas at friends' houses while their\nmoms cooked dinner—and the rotis puffing on the stove we'd ooh and\naah over—I didn't have the confidence to try my favorite dishes at home\nuntil well into my twenties. Conveniently or coincidentally, I worked\ntwo blocks from Kalustyan's, a spice-and-specialty wonderland, mak-\ning it easy to stock up. I have hardly wanted to stop for one minute since.\nThis is a dish I'd been craving for years but I couldn't find the exact rec-\nipe I was looking for. So I took parts of a few of my favorites—a chicken\ncurry from Chetna Makan; a chana masala from Madhur Jaffrey; and\ndal makhani, a black-lentil-and-red-kidney-bean curry enriched with\nbutter and cream—and adjusted everything to get to what I'd envi-\nsioned, which is a more tomato-forward and lightly creamy take on\nmakhani chole (butter chickpeas). The result is so warming, spiced, and\nlush, I had to stop writing this headnote midway to add ingredients for\nthis to my grocery list, because thinking about it again made me crave\nit so much. I hope it has this kind of effect on you, too.\nIn a medium-large (3-quart) heavy pan with a lid, heat the oil over medium-\nhigh heat. Once it's hot, add the onion and cook for 5 to 7 minutes, until\nthe onion is browned at the edges. Add the ginger and garlic, and cook\nfor 1 minute more. Add 1 teaspoon salt, cumin, turmeric, garam masala,\ncoriander, and cayenne, to taste, and cook for 2 minutes. Add the tomato\npaste, and cook until it is one shade darker, 1 to 2 minutes. Add the\ntomatoes, stirring up any stuck bits, season with another 1-1/2 teaspoons\nsalt, and bring to a simmer, stirring. Cook the tomatoes until they begin\nto break down and look saucy, mashing them a bit with your spoon if\nneeded, which takes between 4 and 8 minutes. (Fresh tomatoes cook\ndown faster.) Add 1-1/4 cups water, stir to combine, and reduce the heat to\nthe lowest simmer. Cover, and cook for 5 minutes; then add chickpeas,\nand cook for another 10 minutes, until they have slightly softened\nIf the chickpea mixture looks dry or thick, add more water to loosen. Taste, and adjust the seasoning if needed. Remove from the heat, and stir in 2 tablespoons cream. Gaze at the color and ask yourself if you're in more of a red, orange, or pink mood today. If the last, add the remaining 2 tablespoons cream. Finish with herbs, if using, and serve with rice.\nNotes:\nI sometimes add some toasted paneer or halloumi cubes here as luxurious croutons. Cut an 8-ounce package of paneer or halloumi into 1-inch pieces. In a large nonstick skillet, heat 1 tablespoon of a neutral oil over medium heat. Cook the cheese until it's golden underneath, then flip and lightly brown on the second side. Add to the pot of chickpeas—the warmth will keep them soft— right before serving.\nThe biggest debate in my household over this dish is whether it should be entirely chickpeas (my favorite) or one part chickpeas and one part cauliflower (my husband's). Both are excellent. If you'd like to add cauliflower, reduce the chickpeas to one can, the water to 1 cup; then add 3 cups cauliflower chopped into 1/2 -to-1-inch pieces (about 1 pound total, from half a large head). Add the cauliflower when you add the water, and give it 10 minutes to begin softening before adding the chickpeas. The dish is done when the cauliflower is at your desired level of tenderness.Edit this page",

(Alternatively, you can steam the squash.) Pat the squash dry and toss it into a large bowl.\nAdd the remaining filling ingredients to the bowl and turn them gently with a large rubber spatula to blend. Let the filling sit for 5 minutes or so, just long enough to give the sugar time to melt, then gently mix again.\nRemove the pie plate and top crust from the refrigerator and put the pie plate on a baking sheet lined with parchment or a silicone mat. Spoon the filling into the bottom crust and level the top. Brush the rim of the bottom crust with a little water and center the rolled-out crust over the pie - if the top crust is too cold and not pliable, let it sit for a couple of minutes. Using your fingertips, press the top crust gently against the bottom. Either fold the overhang from the top crust under the bottom crust and crimp the crust attractively, or press the top crust against the bottom crust and trim the overhang from both crusts even with the rim of the pie plate. If you've pressed and trimmed the crust, use the tines of a fork to press the two crusts together.\nUsing a small sharp knife, cut 4 slits in the top crust, and cut a circle out of the center of the crust using the wide end of a pastry tip. (If you have time, refrigerate the pie for about 30 minutes. The pie can also be wrapped airtight and frozen for up to 2 months; bake directly from the freezer, adding about 10 minutes to the baking time.)\nBrush the top of the pie lightly with water and dust with a little sugar. Bake the pie for 55 to 60 minutes, or until it is deeply golden and the filling is bubbling up through the center hole. Check the pie at 40 minutes - if it is already pretty brown, cover it loosely with a foil tent. Transfer the pie to a rack to cool to just warm or to room temperature.\nServing: This is a go-with-ice-cream pie. Try it with vanilla or cinnamon ice cream.\nStoring: This pie is really best served the day it is made. If you must keep it overnight, store it covered in the refrigerator and bring it to room temperature or warm it for a few minutes in a 350-degree-F oven before serving.\n       Edit this page",

Place in a big bowl, cover with cool water just to enough to cover,  and stir in the salt. Place a plate over top to keep the eggplant submerged 20 minutes. Drain and pat dry. (Don’t rinse.)\nPreheat the oven to 375F��\n**Pan Sear:**In a large dutch oven, or ovenproof skillet, over medium-high heat, heat 2 tablespoons oil. Working in 2 batches, brown two sides of the eggplant, until golden, then set these aside. No need to cook through.\n**Make the stew:**Add more oil to the same pan, and the onion and saute 2-3 minutes, stirring. Add the garlic, celery and red pepper and lower heat, cook until tender about 5 minutes. Lower heat to low. Add the spices, canned tomatoes (and juices),  raisins, salt, pepper, chickpeas and veggie broth. Bring to simmer, stirring.\nNestle in the eggplant and give the pan a good shake so the stew levels. It should be like a stew-like. If it seems dry, add a little water. Drizzle with a little olive oil, cover tightly and place in the warm oven.\nBake 20-25 minutes or until eggplant is tender and cooked through. While it’s baking make the couscous.\nRemove the lid, taste adding more saltto taste, keeping in mind the couscous will soak up some of the salt. If you feel the stew needs more flavor overall, add a little more ras el hanout, a 1/2 teaspoon at a time, tasting as you go. If it seems watery, bake uncovered for a few minutes. If dry, add a little water. To serve, Sprinkle with optional  Aleppochili flakes and fresh Parsley. I like adding an additional drizzle of olive oil, or a dollop of yogurt, up to you.\nServe with the cinnamon-scented couscous.\n**To make couscous:**Place broth, oil, spices and saltin a medium pot, and bring to boil. Stir in couscous. Cover and remove from heat. Let stand 7 minutes. Uncover and fluff with fork. Adjust salt.\n\nNOTES​\nSoaking the eggplant, not only seasons it, it helps remove some bitterness and helps the eggplant absorb less oil. Don’t skip this step.Edit this page",

Lightly grease a standard 12-cup muffin tin; or line the tin with papers, and grease the papers.\n\n\nIn a medium-sized bowl, beat together the butter and sugar until well combined.\n\n\nAdd the eggs one at a time, scraping the sides and bottom of the bowl and beating well after each addition.\n\n\nBeat in the baking powder, salt, and vanilla.\n\n\nAdd the flour alternately with the milk, beating gently just to combine. Scrape the bottom and sides of the bowl.\n\n\nMash 1/2 cup of the blueberries. Add the mashed and whole berries to the batter, stirring just to combine and distribute.\n\n\nScoop the batter by the heaping 1/4-cupful into the prepared muffin pan; a muffin scoop works well here.\n\n\nSprinkle about 1 teaspoon granulated sugar atop each muffin, if desired. It's traditional — go for it!\n\n\nBake the muffins for about 30 minutes, until they're light golden brown on top, and a toothpick inserted into the middle of one of the center muffins comes out clean.\n\n\nRemove the muffins from the oven, loosen their edges from the pan, and after about 5 minutes transfer them to a rack to cool.\n\n\nDo the lemon zest /drizzle thing.  You know what I mean.  Yes you do!\n\n\nYield: 12 muffins.\n\n\nTips from our bakers\n\n\nCan you use coarse white sparkling sugar instead of granulated sugar on top of the muffins? Sure; but they won't be \"true\" Jordan Marsh muffins.\n\n\nIf you use frozen berries, don't crush any of them. Rinse several times in cold water, then pat dry with paper towels before using; this will help prevent the muffins from baking up blue-green.\n\n\nRoom-temperature butter is easier to work with than ice-cold butter when preparing muffin batter. If possible, remove butter from the fridge an hour or so before starting the recipe.\n\nEdit this page",

Add 1/2 cup water, then stir in the honey. Heat over medium-high heat until the mixture comes to a low boil and the blueberries just start to break apart. Dissolve the cornstarch in 2 tablespoons cold water in a small bowl, then add the slurry to the saucepan and bring the mixture to a rolling boil.

Place a rack in a roasting pan. Rub 1 tablespoon salt around the inside of the cavity, then stuff it with the thyme, lemon and garlic. Tie the legs closed with cooking twine. Rub olive oil over the entire bird, and sprinkle with 1/2 tablespoon salt and the black pepper. Place on the rack and roast for 72 to 80 minutes. After 72 minutes, begin testing for doneness by inserting a meat thermometer into the leg, close to the bone. The chicken is done when the thermometer reads 165 degrees. Remove from oven and set aside to cool.\nWhen cool enough to handle, remove the skin from the chicken. Use your hands to remove all the meat (remember, it will be hotter internally) and shred into 2-inch strips. If you’re not going to make the salad for a few hours, place the meat in the refrigerator, but be sure to remove it and let come to room temperature for 30 to 45 minutes before serving, to bring out the best flavor.\nMake the dressing: Place all the ingredients except the oil in a food processor and pulse for about 30 seconds, until everything is combined. With the machine on low, slowly drizzle in the oil until dressing is emulsified.\nAssemble the salad: Drizzle pears with lemon juice to prevent them from browning. In a large mixing bowl, combine pears, greens, beans, tomatoes, onion, avocado and half the chicken meat. Add some of the dressing and toss to make sure everything is lightly coated, adding more dressing if needed. Divide the mixture equally among 4 or 6 plates. Lay the rest of the chicken on top and serve immediately, passing the remaining dressing in case people want to add more.\n\nTip​\n\nTo blanch the string beans, bring a small saucepan filled with about 2 inches of water to a simmer. Add the cut beans and cook 1 to 2 minutes (less for crunchier beans), until bright green and just beginning to soften. Using a slotted spoon, transfer beans to a plate to cool.\nEdit this page",

Place chicken on a rimmed baking sheet (or plate), preferably on a rack to allow air to circulate, and refrigerate uncovered for at least 1 hour and up to 24 hours.\nStep 1\nHeat oven to 425 degrees. Remove the rack under the chicken if you’ve used one. If the chicken isn’t on a rimmed baking sheet, transfer it to one (you can line it with parchment to make clean-up easier, but it’s not necessary). Pat the legs dry with a paper towel. Drizzle chicken with the neutral oil. Roast until the chicken is golden brown and the juices run clear when the thickest part of the thigh is pricked with a fork, 30 to 40 minutes.\nStep 2\nWhile chicken is in the oven, make the peanut sauce: In a medium mixing bowl, whisk together soy sauce, vinegar, garlic and ginger until combined, then whisk in sesame oil and honey. Add peanut butter and whisk until smooth. If the mixture is very thick (and this depends on your brand of peanut butter), whisk in a few tablespoons of cold water until it becomes a thick but pourable sauce.\nStep 3\nTransfer chicken to a serving plate and carefully pour any pan juices on the baking sheet into the bowl with the peanut sauce. Whisk until combined. Taste the sauce and add more soy sauce, vinegar or honey if you’d like.\nStep 4\nDrizzle or brush some of the peanut sauce all over chicken pieces, reserving some sauce for serving.

This, this is the soup we make.\nOne of my favorite discoveries of the last few years was that I didn't\nactually need to make, to buy, or even to build-from-bouillon chicken\nstock to make chicken noodle soup. It turns out that just simmering\nboneless, skinless chicken thighs with aromatics in salted water creates\na gentle but delicious soup-building base. With ginger, garlic, scallions,\nand a punchy seasoning added at the end, all efforts to explain calmly\nhow much I love this soup fall short. This is the first recipe I worked on for\nthis book, and, for us, the very definition of a keeper. A deeply flavored\nchicken noodle soup you can make in 45 minutes is one we're going to\nwant to make as often as possible.\nA few things here are key: Chicken thigh cutlets have more fat than\nbreast cutlets, and the richness helps build a more flavorful soup here.\nAdding the soy sauce, vinegar, and sesame oil at the end as a salty, robust\nfinish, versus cooking them into the broth, keeps them from getting lost\nin the soup. This gives it a bit of a hot-and-sour-soup note, too, which is\nalso finished with vinegar.\nBring the chicken, garlic, ginger, scallion whites (reserve greens), salt, pepper, and water to a boil in a 4-to-5-quart pot. Reduce the heat to medium-\nlow, and simmer, uncovered, stirring occasionally, until the chicken is very\ntender and cooked through, about 15 minutes.\nWhile the soup simmers, whisk together the vinegar, soy sauce, and\nsesame oil in a bowl, and add as much or as little chili crisp as your\nheart desires. (Mine desires a lot, but, to keep the less spice-inclined\nkids happy, we use just a smidge and add more to our bowls at the table.)\nRemove the chicken with tongs, and transfer it to a cutting board. Add the noodles and carrot to the broth, following the cooking-time estimate on your noodles' package directions. Use two forks to shred the chicken into bite-sized pieces. Once the noodles are done, return the chicken to the pot, and rewarm for 1 minute. Taste, adjusting seasoning if needed.\nDivide the soup between bowls. Add a handful of scallion greens, and drizzle each bowl with 1 tablespoon of the soy-sauce mixture, adding more to taste.\nNotes:\nDeeper in color and flavor, black vinegar (also sold as black rice vinegar and Chinkiang vinegar) should be very easy to find in an Asian grocery store or online, and I love it here for flavor and color. Should you seek it out, you can also use it for the Soy-Glazed Tofu with Crisped Rice (page 129), which helps give it that dark glaze.\nCook the noodles in the soup right before you want to serve it, or they will keep \"drinking\" the broth until there's little left.Edit this page",

Set aside to cool. While butter cools, separate the eggs. Place yolks in a medium-sized bowl and whites in a small pitcher or bowl where you can whip them. Using a hand-held mixer or your strong arm, whip the egg whites until wet peaks begin to form. Set egg whites aside.\nIn a large bowl, whisk together flour, sugar, baking powder \u0026 salt. Add milk and melted butter to the egg yolks and whisk until combined. Add wet ingredients to dry ingredients and blend completely.\nBefore we add the whipped egg whites to the batter, set the ebelskiver pan on the stovetop over medium heat. Brush each ebelskiver well with a bit of melted butter. As the butter heats up, gently fold whipped egg whites into the batter in two additions. Fold delicately until no visible egg whites remain. \nIt's time to add the batter to the pan once the butter begins to bubble within the ebelskiver wells. For plain ebelskivers, add approximately 3 TBSPs of batter to each well. If you're making jam-filled ebelskivers, drop about 1 TBSP of batter into each well followed by 1 tsp of your favorite jam and top with another 1 TBSP of batter. If you're making ham \u0026 cheese filled ebelskivers, drop about 1 TBSP batter into each well followed by ham \u0026 cheese to your taste and top with another 1 TBSP of batter.\nQuick tip-- fill your ebelskiver wells in the same order every time. Start at the top, work your way around clock-wise, ending with the middle well. This will help each ebelskiver cook evenly... they'll all be in the pan for the same amount of time.\nAfter 3-5 minutes, use your ebelskiver tongs, chopsticks or even little forks to flip each ebelskiver in the pan. Cook approximately 3 minutes more, so that both sides of the ebelskiver cook until lightly browned. \nFlip the fully-cooked ebelskivers out onto a plate and eat immediately or keep warm in a 200 degree oven. I think it's best to eat them right away... they will deflate a little bit the longer they sit in the oven. Edit this page",

Add the onion, bell pepper, scallions (white and light-green parts only), and the Scotch bonnet or habanero pepper (1 teaspoon of the hot pepper will yield a mild-medium heat). Cook, stirring occasionally, until the vegetables begin to soften, about 3 minutes. Add the chard stems and cook, stirring, for another 2 minutes. Add the garlic, thyme, salt and pepper and cook, stirring, until aromatic, another 30 seconds.\nAdd the chard leaves and the water, stir, then cover and cook until the chard is wilted, about 2 minutes.

Uncover and remove from the heat.\nMake the eggs: In a large nonstick skillet over medium heat, heat the oil or melt the butter. Add the eggs and cook to your liking.\nTo serve, place about 3/4 cup of the greens onto each serving plate. Top each with an egg, season to taste with salt and pepper, and garnish with the reserved scallion greens.

Grind figs, raisins, orange, and apple. If the mixture is too dry or thick, mix in up to 1 cup of water, if desired. (I do not use the water, the juice from the apple and orange are enough). The spices and chopped nuts are added to the ground fig mixture. After the fig mixture is ground, I sprinkle them in over the mixture and mix (knead) it in by hand. STICKY!

Trim to desired length, using a diagonal cut. Make small diagonal slits in the sides of the cookies. Bake on ungreased cookie sheet for 10-15 minutes.

If you don't have a springform pan, use a 9-inch cake pan instead. Line the bottom of the pan with a 9-inch parchment baking round. Lightly grease the parchment paper. Place the pan on a baking sheet.\nWhisk the flour, cinnamon, salt, and baking powder together in a small bowl; set aside.\nCut the plum halves in half again and toss them in a medium bowl with the tapioca/cornstarch, brandy (see note below), and ¾ cup of the sugar; set aside for 15 minutes.\nMeanwhile, make the dough. Beat the butter and remaining sugar together until light and fluffy, about 1 minute at medium-high speed. With the mixer on low, gradually add the dry ingredients and stir just until it starts to come together. Add 1 tablespoon of the water and stir the mixture for about 30 seconds, until it becomes crumbly and just holds together when lightly squeezed. If the mixture still seems a little dry at this point, stir in another tablespoon of water.\nReserve about 1 cup of the dough on the side and press the remaining dough into the bottom of the prepared pan in an even layer and working the dough about 1 inch up the sides of the pan. Pour the fruit mixture evenly over the dough (or neatly arrange the plums in concentric circles if you want the tart a little less \"rustic\"). Crumble the remaining dough over the top of the fruit.\nBake for 55 - 65 minutes, until the fruit is bubbly and the crust is golden brown. Cool the tart for 15 minutes before running a knife around the inside edge and removing the sides of the pan.  Serve warm or at room temperature with or without ice cream. Vanilla and cinnamon vanilla bean are perfect choices here, especially if you're into making your own, though we ate ours with a local crème fraîche ice cream I found recently and we were not at all disappointed.\n\nNotes:\n\nIf you can't find Italian plums for this plum tart, don't fret. Other plum varieties will work nicely here too!\nYou can swap the brandy for cognac, water, or orange juice.\nEdit this page",

You will probably get a bit of crumbling just on the edges of the first couple of slices, this is normal and indicative of the tenderness of the meatloaf (zero crumble indicates firm packed harder meatloaf which isn’t as enjoyable!).\nIdeal served with a dollop of ketchup, creamy mashed potatoes and steamed vegetables.\nEdit this page",

        "Content": "Mini Cherry Pies with Homemade Cherry FillingMini Cherry Pies with Homemade Cherry Filling\nDesserts Want to make Picnic Fare\nServings: 24 mini pies      \nIngredients:   \nPie Crust:\n2 1/4 cups all-purpose flour, plus more for bench and cutters\n2 tablespoons sugar\n1/4 teaspoon fine sea salt\n2 sticks chilled unsalted butter, cut into 1/2-inch cubes\n4 tablespoons ice water, plus more as needed\nFilling:\n4 cups fresh pitted cherries\n1 cup sugar\n2 tablespoons cornstarch\n1 tablespoon fresh lemon zest\nCooking spray\nDirections:\nPreheat the oven to 425 degrees F. Spray a 24 cup mini muffin tin or 2 (12 cup) mini muffin tins with cooking spray.\nFor the crust: In a food processor, combine the flour, sugar, salt and butter. Pulse the processor until the mixture resembles fine sand. Remove the lid and add the ice water to the mixture. Run the processor just until the mixture rolls itself into a little ball. If the mixture is a bit dry, add more ice water by the tablespoonful until it comes together. Gather the dough into a ball. With a bench scraper or knife, divide the mixture evenly in half. Shape each half into a disk. Wrap each disk in plastic wrap and chill at least 30 minutes.\nCook's Note: At this point you can keep the wrapped dough in the refrigerator for a few days or freeze for later use.\nFor the filling: In a saucepan, combine the pitted cherries and 1 cup water over medium-low heat for 10 minutes. In a small bowl, combine the sugar and cornstarch. Using a whisk, swirl the ingredients together, making sure that there aren't any lumps in the cornstarch. Add the sugar-cornstarch mixture and lemon zest to the cherries. Cook the cherry mixture until it comes to a rolling boil. Cook 1 minute more, until thickened. Allow the cherry filling to cool slightly while you prepare the crust.\nRoll the dough disks out into 10-inch rounds on a well-floured work surface. With a 1 1/2-inch round cookie or biscuit cutter, edge lightly dipped in flour, cut 24 rounds from the first rolled out disk. With a 2-inch round cookie or biscuit cutter, edge lightly dipped in flour, cut 24 rounds from the second rolled out disk. You should have a total of 24 (1 1/2-inch) rounds and 24 (2-inch) rounds for matching top and bottom crusts.\nGently fit the 2-inch dough rounds into the bottom of the prepared mini muffin tin. Make sure to pat down the bottom and the excess coming up the sides. Spoon about 1 heaping tablespoon cooled pie filling into each crust-lined cup. Fit the top of each mini pie with a 1 1/2-inch dough round, pushing down gently and sealing the bottom crust and top crust by crimping the edges together with a fork. With a sharp paring knife, make 3 small incisions on the top crust, to allow the steam to escape.\nBake until the edges are golden brown and the filling is bubbly, about 12 minutes. Allow to cool on a wire rack, and then remove from the muffin tin.\n       Edit this page",

Grease a tube pan.\n\n\nPeel, core and chop apples into 1-inch chunks. Toss with cinnamon and 5 tablespoons sugar and set aside.\n\n\nStir together flour, baking powder and salt in a large mixing bowl.\n\n\nIn a separate bowl, whisk together oil, orange juice, sugar, vanilla and eggs.\n\n\nMix wet ingredients into dry ones; scrape down the bowl to ensure all ingredients are incorporated.\n\n\nPour half of batter into prepared pan.\n\n\nSpread half of apples (and their juices) over it.\n\n\nPour the remaining batter over the apples and arrange the remaining apples on top.\n\n\nBake for about 1 1/2 hours, or until a tester comes out clean.*\n\n\nCool completely before running a knife between the cake and pan, and unmolding onto a platter.\n\n\nDo ahead: This cake is awesome on the first day but absolutely glorious and pudding-like on the days that follow, so feel free to get an early start on it. I keep it at room temperature covered with foil.\nNote: The apples love to hide uncooked pockets of batter, especially near the top. Make sure your testing skewer or toothpick goes not just all the way down to the bottom, but does a shallow dip below the top layer of apples to make sure it comes out batter-free. Should your cake be browning too fast, before the center is baked through, cover it with foil for all but the last few minutes in the oven.Edit this page",

Toast lightly until fragrant, about 30 seconds; add remaining 6 minced garlic cloves and white and pale-green scallions. Sauté until just soft, about 2 minutes. Add remaining 1/2 cup soy sauce, orange juice, and honey. Bring to a boil and cook until sauce is thick, 12–15 minutes.\nPreheat broiler. Line a rimmed baking sheet with foil. Place ribs on prepared sheet; brush with sauce. Broil until sauce bubbles, 2-3 minutes. Turn, brush with additional sauce, and broil until ribs are heated through and sauce is bubbling, 2-3 minutes longer. Transfer to a platter. Drizzle with remaining sauce. Sprinkle dark-green scallions and citrus zest over.\n       \n               \n             Edit this page",

At low speed, mix in flour mixture in 3 batches just until a dough forms. Quarter dough and form each piece into a 6-inch disk, then chill, wrapped separately in plastic wrap, until firm, 2 to 3 hours.\nCut and bake cookies:\nStep 3\nPreheat oven to 350°F with rack in middle.\nStep 4​\nRoll out 1 piece of dough between sheets of parchment paper into an 11-inch round (1/8 inch thick). Slide dough in parchment onto a tray and chill until firm, about 15 minutes.\nStep 5​\nCut out as many cookies as possible with cookie cutter (chill dough again if necessary), reserving and chilling scraps. Transfer cookies to a parchment-lined large baking sheet, arranging them 1 inch apart.\nStep 6​\nBake until edges are golden-brown, 9 to 12 minutes. Cool on baking sheet 5 minutes, then slide cookies, still on parchment, onto a rack to cool completely.\nStep 7​\nMake more cookies with remaining dough and scraps (reroll only once) on cooled freshly lined baking sheets.\nStep 8​\nIf icing cookies and coloring icing, transfer small batches to small bowls, 1 for each color, and tint with food coloring. Spoon each color of icing into separate sealable bags, pressing out excess air, and snip an 1/8-inch opening in 1 bottom corner of each bag. Pipe icing onto a plate to test consistency. If too thick, thin a small batch with a few drops of orange juice.\nStep 9​\nDecoratively pipe icing onto cookies, then sprinkle with decorative sugar (if using) and let dry completely, about 1 hour (depending on humidity).\nCook's notes:\n· To make three-dimensional cookies, start with cut (but not baked) cookies on lined baking sheet. Make a 1 1/2-inch-long notch (1/3 inch wide) in each cookie, cutting toward center. If you want to make the cookies into ornaments, punch out a small hole (for string or ribbon to go through) on each side of notch on half of cookies using a piping tip with a 1/4-inch round opening. Bake and cool as directed. To make sure pairs of cookies fit, interlock cookies (one cookie with holes and one without) at notches to form sphere- or cube-like shapes. If necessary, carefully trim notches with a small sharp knife. If desired, ice unassembled cookies, avoiding middle portion near notch. Tie string or ribbon (if using) through holes of cookies and interlock. · Using a pastry bag fitted with a piping tip results in cleaner lines of icing. · Dough can be chilled up to 2 days. · Cookies (not interlocked) keep, layered between sheets of parchment if iced, in an airtight container at room temperature 1 week.Edit this page",

Zest all 4 oranges into this mixture, squeeze in a few teaspoons of juice, and heat over medium heat until it starts to steam. Remove from the heat and let steep, covered, for at least 1 hour (and not more than 2 or 3, but I don’t know why you’d put another hour or two between you and eating this ice cream).\n\n\nRewarm the milk mixture. Pour the remaining cream into a large bowl with a mesh strainer on top (or some configuration where you’ll strain the milk mixture into the bowl of cream, to remove the pods and any curds that form in the coming steps).\n\n\nWhisk together the egg yolks in another bowl that is big enough to hold the eggs and the milk mixture. Slowly pour in the warmed milk mixture, whisking all the time. Pour all of this back in the pan.\n\n\nCook the milk/egg mixture to form the custard – over medium heat, whisking constantly, until mixture thickens and coats the back of a spoon so you can leave a trail (the typical making ice cream routine – if you’ve never done it before, consult a cookbook or the internet for more info about this and about how to keep your custard from curdling).\n\n\nStrain the custard into the cream using the strainer, which will catch the cardamom detritus and extraneous zest (don’t worry, the flavor has seeped into the custard). Stir.\n\n\nChill the mixture until not warm – either in an ice bath, in a stopped sink filled shallow with cold water (my preferred method), or just on the counter. Chill overnight or as desired (I did about 7 hours), then make in your ice cream maker per manufacturer’s instructions. Freeze overnight or until desired consistency.\n\n\n       \n           Edit this page",

        "Content": "Orange RollsOrange Rolls\nBreads\nYield: 8 rolls\nINGREDIENTS:\nFor the Dough:\n\n1⅔ cups all-purpose flour, plus more for rolling\n1¾ tsp baking powder\n¼ tsp fine salt\n3 Tbsps cold unsalted butter, cut into small pieces, plus softened butter for the pan\n2 Tbsp cold cream cheese\n⅔ cup whole milk or half-and-half\n\nFor the Filling:\n\n⅓ cup packed light brown sugar\n1 orange, zested\n½ tsp ground cinnamon or a combination of cinnamon and cardamom\n2 Tbsps unsalted butter, very soft\n\nFor the Glaze:\n\n¼ cup cream cheese, room temperature\n3 Tbsp confectioners’ sugar, or to taste\n1 orange\n\nPREPARATION:\n\nMake the dough: Heat the oven to 375 degrees. Place the brown sugar in a small bowl and zest the orange directly over it. Gently rub the zest into the sugar and transfer 2 tablespoons/25 grams to a large bowl to use for the dough. Save the rest of the orange sugar for the filling.\nStep 1\nAdd the flour, baking powder and salt to the large bowl and whisk well. Add the butter and cream cheese, and smash and rub them into the dry ingredients with your fingertips until they’re fully incorporated and the mixture resembles crumbs.\nStep 2\nAdd the milk all at once and stir gently with a fork until the dough comes together and no dry bits remain. Freeze while you prepare the pan and filling. Very generously butter the bottom and sides of an 8-inch round cake pan or ovenproof skillet.\nStep 3\nMake the filling: Mix the cinnamon (and cardamom, if using) into the reserved orange sugar.\nStep 4\nScrape the dough onto a well-floured work surface. Use a floured rolling pin to roll the dough or flour your hands to pat the dough into a 12-by-5-inch rectangle. It may be sticky, but that’s OK. Just flour the dough enough to be able to shape it.\nStep 5\nTo fill the dough, spread the very soft butter evenly over the surface, then sprinkle the orange sugar on top. Starting with one long side of the dough, roll it up into a 12-inch-long log. If it’s stuck to the surface, scrape it up as you roll it using a bench scraper or stiff spatula.\nStep 6\nUse a serrated knife to cut the log with a sawing motion into 8 (1½-inch-thick) slices. Place a slice in the center of the pan, then space the remaining slices ½-inch apart around it. At this point, the rolls can be covered and chilled for up to 2 days before baking directly from the refrigerator.\nStep 7\nBake until golden on top, 23 to 25 minutes. You don’t want to overbake, but also want the dough to be cooked through. When you press the top, the roll shouldn’t sink but spring back just a little.\nStep 8\nIf you’d like to glaze the rolls, make the glaze while the rolls bake: Place the cream cheese then the confectioners’ sugar in a bowl. Zest the orange directly over the sugar, then mix and smush together until smooth. Squeeze in 2 tablespoons orange juice and mix well. The glaze should be a bit thick because it will loosen when it hits the hot rolls. Taste and add more confectioners’ sugar if you’d like. Stir in more juice if it’s too stiff.\nStep 9\nLet the rolls cool for 5 minutes in the pan, then spread the glaze all over them. Cool a bit longer to serve hot or warm.\nStep 10\nEdit this page",

Carefully fold in the egg white mixture, taking care not to overmix.\nFor the big fluffy pancakes and sausage: Preheat a large nonstick pan over low heat and add the butter.\nSpray 3-inch round (2-inch tall) ring molds with cooking spray. Place the ring molds in your preheated pan and use a ladle to fill the molds two-thirds of the way with the pancake mix. Place a cover over the pan and let the pancakes cook for 10 minutes. Remove the cover and use tongs and a rubber spatula to help flip the ring molds with the pancakes. Cover and continue cooking for about 7 minutes more.\nMeanwhile, cook your sausage in a skillet over medium-low heat until the pork is fully cooked, about 4 minutes on each side.\nRemove the ring molds with the pancakes using tongs and a rubber spatula. The pancakes should slide right out. Add the sausage underneath your pancakes for even more height. Serve with butter and maple syrup.\nEdit this page",

Cover the bowl with plastic wrap and let rise in a warm place for at least 6 hours, or overnight.\nIn a small bowl, combine the raisins and grappa or brandy, and let marinate for at least 4 hours, or overnight.\nIn a large bowl, stir the butter, eggs, yolks, sugar, warm water and vanilla together. Drain the marinated raisins in a small strainer set over a bowl and press on the raisins with a spoon to extract as much liquid as possible. Set the raisins aside and add the liquid to the egg mixture. Add the sponge and mix well with your hands.

Cover with a clean cloth and let rise for 6 hours in a warm place.\nButter and flour a panettone or other deep mold at least 6½ inches tall and 7 to 8 inches wide. (The ceramic insert to a crockpot is ideal. Or you can use two 2-pound coffee cans and make 2 smaller loaves. Panettone can also be baked in two greased and floured 6 by 6-inch clay flowerpots.)\nPunch down the dough and turn it out onto a floured surface. Flatten the dough out with your hands and sprinkle on the lemon and orange zest. In a small bowl, mix the raisins and citron with the 1 tablespoon flour, and sprinkle the mixture over the dough.

Process until smooth. Transfer the pureed asparagus to a fine-mesh strainer set over a small bowl. Let the juices drain, 5 to 10 minutes, pressing down lightly on the puree with a wooden spoon occasionally. Reserve the juice and discard the pulp.\nBring a large pot of generously salted water to a boil.\nMeanwhile, in a large bowl, whisk the ricotta, Parmesan and 1 tablespoon lemon juice with some salt and pepper. Add the lemon zest and set aside.\nOnce the water has boiled, add the pasta and cook according to the package instructions until al dente.\nMeanwhile, add the olive oil to a large skillet over medium heat. Add the garlic and cook until lightly golden, about 2 minutes. Remove the garlic, then add the sliced asparagus and saute until tender, 3 to 5 minutes. Drain the pasta directly into the skillet with the asparagus. Add about half of the asparagus juice and allow to simmer for 1 minute. Add the remaining asparagus juice and the remaining tablespoon lemon juice and cook until the pasta is glossy, about 1 minute. Transfer to a bowl and garnish with Pecorino-Romano, lemon zest, dollops of the whipped ricotta, basil and black pepper.\n\nCook’s Note​\nFresh ricotta has a much more delicate flavor than most kinds with additives found in plastic tubs. You can find fresh ricotta in Italian markets or sometimes in supermarkets, mounded up high and packaged in small tin pails. It is often labeled as hand-dipped, hand-packed or hand-ladled. If you can't find fresh ricotta in the tins, Calabro is a good brand found in plastic tubs. If the ricotta is wet, drain in a damp cheesecloth-lined strainer set over a bowl in the refrigerator for a couple of hours.Edit this page",

Add the granulated sugar and mix on medium until it holds stiff peaks. Add the powdered sugar and salt and whisk on medium-high to tighten, about 1 minute. Scrape the bowl down with a spatula and whisk on high for 30 seconds just to make sure it's even in texture with glossy hard peaks.\nPut the mixture into a disposable pastry bag and snip off the top inch. Pipe the egg white mixture on the lined sheet trays in six 3- to 4-inch filled-in circles, as if you are putting icing on top of a cupcake. Create a well on each pavlova using the bottom of a spoon, then bake until the pavlovas are hard to the touch, about 2 hours. Allow to cool completely at room temperature on a wire rack before serving.\nFor the lemon curd whipped cream: Meanwhile, put the juice, zest, yolks, granulated sugar and scraped vanilla seeds into a medium pot. Turn the heat on medium-high and cook, constantly stirring with a rubber spatula in a figure 8 motion until it coats the back of a spoon, about 10 minutes. Stir in the butter, salt and 1 cup cream until completely combined. Remove from the heat and pour through a fine mesh strainer into a shallow dish. Allow to cool for a minute or two before covering with plastic wrap, touching the curd to prevent a skin from forming. Put the dish in the refrigerator and allow to cool completely, about 30 minutes.\nWhip the remaining 3 cups cream to medium peaks in the bowl of a stand mixer fitted with a whisk attachment. Fold the cooled lemon curd into the whipped cream and keep cold until ready to assemble.\nWhen ready to serve, place the lemon curd whipped cream in a pastry bag and snip off just the top 1/2-inch. Put 1 small dollop on each serving plate. Place a pavlova on top and lightly press down into the lemon cream to prevent it from sliding. Pipe 1 large dollop of lemon curd whipped cream into the center of the pavlova where you created the well. Garnish with the berries on top of the whipped cream and on the plate, giving it a natural look, rather than an overly plated look. Dust with the powdered sugar.\nEdit this page",

Line twelve standard muffin cups with paper liners, or coat with nonstick spray.\nHalve, pit, and thinly slice the peaches. Set twenty-four to thirty-six slices aside for decoration; if the slices are longer than the muffin cups, trim them down. Chop the remaining peach slices into small pieces. You need only 1-1/2 cups; the rest are snacks.\nMix the butter, sugar, a pinch of salt, and half of the flour (1 cup plus 2 tablespoons, or 145 grams) in a large bowl until it forms a clumpy mixture. Remove 6 semi-packed tablespoons (about 115 grams) and set it aside; this will be your crumbs.

Cook over medium to medium-high heat to maintain a gentle bubbling, stirring frequently with a spatula, until the fruit has mostly broken down and turned almost jammy, about 20 minutes. Use the spatula to gently mash the fruit until fairly smooth. Cool slightly.\nGrind the freeze-dried peaches in a food processor to a fine powder; some larger pieces are okay. Add the cooked peaches and lemon juice; process to form a puree. Pass the puree through a fine-mesh strainer, pressing on the solids to extract as much liquid as possible. Discard the solids.

Bring to a rolling boil, reducing the heat as needed to make sure the mixture does not boil over; cook for 4 minutes. Remove from the heat just long enough to gradually whisk in the cornstarch slurry; return the mixture to a boil over medium-high heat and cook for about 1 minute, stirring with a spatula, until slightly thickened, with a consistency a little thicker than heavy cream. Remove from the heat.\nGradually whisk the hot-milk mixture into the cream cheese, until smooth, then whisk in the strained peach puree. Cover the bowl and refrigerate* it until thoroughly chilled, at least overnight.\nWhen you are ready to churn, assemble your ice cream machine according to the manufacturer's directions and turn it on. Pour in the chilled ice cream base and spin until it's thick and creamy -- about the consistency of soft-serve ice cream.\nMeanwhile, sprinkle about one-quarter of the crushed Amaretti cookies and crystallized ginger onto the bottom of your final storage container. Pack the ice cream into the storage container, alternating it with additional layers of the amaretti and ginger, ending with a layer of the add-ins on top; do not stir (to retain the layering). Press a sheet of parchment paper directly against the surface, and seal with a tight-fitting lid. Freeze in the coldest part of your freezer until firm, for at least 4 hours.\n*NOTE: To use the base sooner: Pour the mixture into a 1-gallon resealable zip-top bag and seal.

Blend the mint, basil, nuts, cheese, lemon juice, garlic, 3/4 teaspoon of salt, and 1/2 teaspoon of pepper in a food processor until the herbs are finely chopped. With the machine running, gradually blend in 1/3 cup of oil until the mixture is smooth and creamy.\nGenerously sprinkle the lamb racks with salt and pepper.

Repeat with the remaining 2 lamb racks.\nRoast the lamb in the oven until cooked to desired doneness, about 20 minutes for medium-rare. Transfer the lamb racks to a work surface. Set aside for 10 minutes. Cut the lamb between the bones into single chops. Spread the pesto over 1 cut side of each chop. Arrange the chops, pesto side up, on plates or a platter, and serve.\nDo-Ahead Tip: The pesto and lamb racks may be prepared up to this point 1 day ahead. Cover the pesto and lamb separately and refrigerate. Allow extra time for the chilled lamb to roast.\nAlternately, the racks of lamb can be sliced then broiled before serving. To broil the lamb: Use 18 to 24 meaty single lamb rib chops (about 2 1/2 ounces each, from 3 racks of lamb). Preheat the broiler. Arrange the lamb chops in a single layer over 2 heavy baking sheets. Lightly brush the lamb chops with oil and sprinkle with salt and pepper. Watching closely, broil the lamb chops 3 inches from the heat source until cooked to desired doneness, about 3 minutes per side for medium-rare. Spread the pesto over the chops.

Blend on medium speed for 15 seconds, until the batter is smooth and lump-free. Scrape down the sides of the blender and pour in the melted butter. Blend it again for a few seconds just to incorporate the butter. Refrigerate the batter for 1 hour to let it rest.\nFilling: In a small bowl combine the ricotta cheese, cream cheese, egg, confectioners' sugar, and zest and blend until smooth. Chill until ready to use.\nSauce: Combine the strawberries, sugar, water, cornstarch, and zest in a small pot over medium heat. Bring to a simmer and stir gently until the berries release their natural juices. The consistency should remain a bit chunky, it will thicken up when it cools down.\nCrepes: Put an 8-inch crepe pan or nonstick skillet over medium heat and brush with a little melted butter. Pour 1/4 cup batter into the pan and swirl it around so it covers the bottom evenly; pour back any excess. Cook until the crepe batter sets and the bottom is lightly browned, about 2 minutes. Use a heatproof rubber spatula to loosen the crepe and flip it. Cook it on the other side for about 1 minute. Slide them onto a plate and continue making the crepes until all the batter is used. Cover the stack with a towel to keep them from drying out. Makes about 10 crepes.\nSpoon 1/4 cup of the cheese filling along the lower third of the crepe. Fold the bottom edge away from you to just cover the filling; then fold the 2 sides in to the center. Roll the crepe away from you a couple of times ending with the seam side down. Put an ovenproof skillet over medium heat and brush with melted butter. Pan-fry the blintzes top side down until crisp and golden, about 2 to 3 minutes. Flip them over, transfer the pan to the oven, and bake for 10 minutes so the cheese mixture sets. Using a spatula, transfer the blintzes to serving plates. Spoon the strawberry sauce on top, dust with confectioners' sugar, and serve immediately.       \n       Edit this page",

Spread them on a baking sheet, and roast on top rack for 30-40 minutes, rolling them around on tray from time to time, until they turn browned and crisp.

Half the eggplants lengthwise, arrange them, cut side up, in one layer on oiled pan. Brush the cut sides lightly with a tiny amount of oil, and sprinkle them with generously with salt and black pepper. Roast for 15 minutes until they are browned on top. Carefully flip the eggplants so their cut sides are against the pan, and roast another 15 minutes, until they are bronzed underneath and tender throughout. (If you are using larger eggplants, you may need to adjust cooking times slightly.)\nYogurt-Tahini Sauce:\nWhisk together tahini, yogurt, lemon juice, garlic, and salt; the mixture will become very thick and stiff. Add water, a tablespoon at a time, until mixture is smooth, with a thick but pourable consistency.\nPutting together:\nArrange the eggplant sections, cut side up, on a large platter. Dollop each piece generously with the yogurt-tahini sauce. Sprinkle with crisped chickpeas and parsley.Edit this page",

Roast at 425 degrees for about 20 minutes, until they're tender and the juices are starting to spill out on to the pan.\nPlace the plums into a blender, taking care to scrape up any juices on your baking sheet and add those to the blender (you don't want to lose that condensed flavor magic!). Add ground cardamom and puree until smooth.\nPlace your puree in the fridge to cool. \nCustard:\nUsing a stand mixer with the whisk attachment, a hand mixer, or a really super strong arm - whisk together the egg yolks and 1/2 cup of the sugar until it doubles in size, lightens to a pale yellow, and gains a silky ribbony texture. This should take a few minutes. \nHeat the cream, remaining 1/4 cup sugar, cardamom pods, and ground or bean vanilla (wait until later in the process if you're using the extract) to a scald, which is before a simmer but nice and steamy. \nWith the mixer running, slowly pour the cream mixture into the yolks until fully combined to temper your eggs. Then pour the mixture back into the pot and heat over medium heat until your custard has formed (if you don't feel comfortable knowing when that is, use a thermometer and look for 180 degrees). While it's heating, use a silicone spatula to gently scrape the bottom of the pan and stir slowly. \nWhen you've reached 180 degrees, strain the custard through a fine mesh sieve into a medium bowl, and set that bowl into a larger one with a bit of ice and water in it to create a cooling water bath. Spin the inner bowl with one hand, while holding your spatula in the custard like a rudder to help the mixture cool evenly. \nOnce it has cooled significantly, stir in the plum puree (and the vanilla extract if you're using it) until fully combined and let chill for a few hours. \nIce Cream:\nChurn based on your machine's instructions. I have a Cuisinart 2 Quart ice cream maker, and this recipe filled it to the brim. If your machine is smaller, you may want to churn this in two batches, or cut the recipe by a bit! Edit this page",

It's a vividly colored crunchy, nutty, and spicy mix of asparagus, carrots, and avocado, springlike vegetables that, rather conveniently in a place where \"spring\" vegetables may not emerge from the soil until spring is two-thirds over, taste pretty great from the produce we find at the grocery store. I know that mayo is a highly controversial ingredient, but mayo seasoned with toasted sesame oil and soy sauce is a whole other thing, a thing I refuse to believe anyone wouldn't want to lick from a spoon. It's rivetingly good. Here, it dresses the crunchy vegetables and rich cubes of avocado in a way that lightly coats them but, I promise, doesn't scream \"mayo salad\" in any way. This is one of my favorite lunch salads, and you should not believe the serving suggestion at all: the recipe is just for you.\nHold the asparagus by the tough end (no need to snap it off) and carrots by the stem end, and cut each diagonally into thin slices. Place these in a large bowl, and dress with rice vinegar and a few pinches of salt.\nCombine the mayonnaise, sesame oil, sriracha, and soy sauce in a small bowl, whisking until smooth.\nWhen you're ready to eat the salad, add the dressing to the asparagus and carrots, and stir to coat evenly. Add the diced avocado, and gently fold it in. Taste for seasoning, and add salt and more sriracha to your liking. Finish with the sesame seeds.Edit this page",

Add pork, panko and basil. Using your hands, gently mix everything together, making sure not to overwork the mixture. (Otherwise, the meatballs get tough.) Form into 1 1/4-inch balls.\nHeat a large skillet over medium-high, then add the oil and let it heat up until it thins out. Add meatballs in one layer. Cook, turning and shaking the pan, until meatballs are browned all over, 5 to 7 minutes.\nPour the wine into the skillet and move meatballs over to one side of the pan, scraping up the browned bits. Add peaches, a pinch of salt and 2 tablespoons water to the empty side of pan. When peaches are simmering, cover the pan, lower the heat to medium, and let cook until the meatballs are no longer pink at their centers, and the peaches juicy and tender, about 5 to 10 minutes longer.\nUncover the pan. If the mixture seems too runny, let it cook down for another minute or so. The peaches should break down into a chunky sauce. Hard or unripe peaches may take a few extra minutes.\nAdd the onions to the pan and mix them in so they wilt slightly. Squeeze lime juice all over everything, then taste and add salt and lime juice, as needed. Sweeter peaches will need more lime juice, tart ones, less.\nServe the meatballs sprinkled with more cumin and garnished with torn basil leaves, over the rice or greens.\nEdit this page",

It's usually during lunch on a weekday, which on all of the days when I'm not working on a wildly successful, ready-by-1:00-p.m. recipe that I don't need to save for dinner—that would be just about all of the days—is highly likely to be a peanut-butter-and-jelly sandwich. When I do make time for experimentation, canned beans are one of my favorite muses. My two favorite things to do with them are to treat them as you would pasta—warming them in some tomato sauce with Parmesan, or an aglio olio, or a basil pesto—or to apply a favorite salad dressing to them and scoop them onto toast. This version is a little of both. To a quadfecta of ingredients—olive oil, garlic, anchovies, and lemon—that could make a crumpled piece of paper taste good (note: not fact-checked), I add a smidge of Dijon mustard and a small amount of capers (they're so good here; please, try them), and warm a can of beans in it. They're finished with some fried breadcrumbs reminiscent of the croutons essential to all good Caesar salads, and Parmesan, and then you're supposed to slide them onto a bowl or plate—but nobody\nis going to know if you eat them straight from the pan.\nIn a medium-sized skillet, warm 1 to 2 tablespoons of olive oil over medium\nheat; then add the breadcrumbs. Season with salt, and cook, stirring,\nuntil they're crisp and evenly golden brown, about 5 minutes. Scrape them\ninto a bowl and set aside.\nOn a cutting board, mince together the garlic, anchovies, and capers. Heat\nanother 2 tablespoons of olive oil in the skillet over medium-high heat.\nAdd the garlic-caper mixture, pepper flakes, and zest, and cook until the garlic is lightly golden at the edges. Add the beans, and cook until they're warmed through, 2 to 3 minutes. Stir in the Dijon mustard, and cook with the beans for 30 seconds. The beans will look a little creamy; add 1 table- spoon water if they don't. Season with salt to taste. Turn the heat off, and finish with a squeeze of lemon juice. Transfer to a bowl or plate, and finish with crumbs, Parmesan, and parsley, if using. Eat right away.Edit this page",

Do the same with remaining racks. Return ribs to the grill and cook meat-side down for 30 minutes, maintaining low heat. Occasionally check the grill to make sure it remains low. After 30 minutes, flip the foil bundles and continue cooking.\nAfter 1 hour of cooking, remove the ribs from the grill and let rest in the foil for 30 minutes. Meanwhile, raise grill heat to medium-high. Cut the lemon in half and grill flesh-side down until nicely marked and slightly soft, 3 to 5 minutes.\nWhen done resting, remove the ribs from the foil and place on the grill meat-side down and cook for 4 minutes.

Pound until even thickness, but not so thin it starts breaking apart. Around 3/4\" is fine. Cut and discard any parts around the breast that rip off (can cut the tails off to create circle/burger shape if you want). Repeat with remaining breasts.\nMarinate: In a large mixing bowl combine buttermilk, hot sauce, salt and white pepper. Add in the chicken breasts and combine to ensure they'll all coated. Cover with cling film and marinate in the fridge. I recommend a minimum of 4 hours (up to overnight) but just as long as you have time for. Take the chicken out the fridge 30mins before needed to bring close to room temp_ (see notes)._\nDredge: In a large shallow dish or tray combine flour with paprika, cayenne pepper, onion \u0026 garlic powder, baking powder and salt \u0026 black pepper. One by one coat the breasts in the flour, making sure you completely coat each time. Really get in all the cracks and crevices of the chicken to create lots of little flaky parts. Place to one side.\nFry: In a large pot or deep pan heat up oil to 180C/356F. In batches of 1-2 (depending on pot size), carefully lower the chicken in the hot oil. The temp will likely drop to around 165C/300F, just maintain that heat as the chicken fries. Depending on the thickness of the chicken it'll take around 4-5mins on one side, then flip and continue frying for another couple of minutes. The chicken should be deep golden, visibly crunchy with the bubbling oil starting to slow down. The internal temp of the chicken should reach 75C/165F. Carefully remove and rest on wire rack with paper towels underneath (don't place directly on paper towel or they'll lose crispiness). Bring oil temp back up to 180C/356F between each batch.\nGlaze: Once you've fried the 4 breasts, scoop out 1/2cup of the oil and pour into a mixing bowl. Add in honey, hot sauce, smoked paprika, garlic powder, salt \u0026 black pepper and whisk until it emulsifies and thickens into a glaze. Brush both sides of the chicken with the glaze.\nSandwich: Stack the sandwich in the following order - toasted bun, mayonnaise, lettuce, chicken, pickles \u0026 jalapeños, top bun.

Heat a cast iron skillet large enough to hold the pork. Add the oil and when it begins to smoke lightly, use a pair of metal tongs to place the pork into the hot oil. Cook over high heat, turning the pork often, browning on all sides, until it reaches an internal temperature of 145 degrees F in the thickest part of the tenderloin, about 15 minutes total (if you like a little more \"done\", cook a few minutes longer on each side). Remove the pork and allow it to \"rest\" on a flat surface. If you like a little more \"done\", cook a few minutes longer on each side.\nMake the sauce: In a medium bowl, combine the vinegar, soy sauce, honey, fish sauce, and ginger. Add the scallions. Taste for seasoning. Set aside.\nAssemble the wraps: On a large serving platter, arrange \"cups\" of lettuce leaves, 2 to 3 layers of lettuce per cup. Form the cups with one leaf inside another with the lettuce spines stacked on top of the other.\nSlice the pork into 1/4-inch thick rounds. Top each lettuce cup with 3 or 4 slices of pork. Season the pork with a little more salt, then top with the chiles. Drizzle the meat with some of the sauce. Top with the cilantro leaves. Top with more sauce if you like.\nEdit this page",

Sear the beef in two or three batches until browned on each side, about 8 minutes total, removing the meat to a dish once seared.\nAdd the butter to the pan and turn the heat down to medium. Add the carrots, celery and onions, season with salt and pepper and cook for 5 minutes or until softened and lightly brown. Add the garlic and cook for an additional minute or two. Add the tomato paste, brown sugar, Worcestershire sauce, thyme, bay leaves and beef. Scatter with remaining 2 tablespoons flour and stir well to combine. Add the stout, scraping the bottom of the pan to release any brown bits. Add the beef stock and potatoes and bring the mixture to a boil. Cover with a tight-fitting lid, transfer to the oven and cook for 1 1/2 to 2 hours or until the beef is tender.\nTransfer the beef and vegetables to a bowl, leaving the braising liquid in the pan. Place the braising liquid over high heat. Bring to a boil to reduce by about half. Keep warm over low heat or if prepping in advance, transfer to a container and place in the fridge for up to 2 days or freezer for 3 months.\nSeason the beef and veg with more salt and pepper, if needed, and set aside to cool completely.\nFor the pastry: Meanwhile, make the pastry by combining the butter and water in a large saucepan. Bring to a boil and melt the butter. Remove from the heat and add the flour and salt. Stir to bring together and turn out onto a lightly floured surface. When cool enough to handle, knead the dough until very smooth and a little elastic. Wrap in plastic and set aside to rest for 30 minutes.\nWhen ready to bake, set a rack to the bottom position and preheat your oven to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C). Wrap the outside of a 9-inch springform pan with aluminum foil.\nOn a lightly floured surface, divide the pastry in two, one slightly smaller than the other. Roll the larger piece of pastry out to 1/2-centimeter (1/4-inch) thick and transfer to the springform pan, lining the bottom and up the sides. Fill with the cooled beef and veg. Roll out the remaining pastry and drape over the filling, crimping and sealing the edges with a fork or by pinching with your fingers. Beat together the egg and milk and brush over the top of the pie. Cut a vent into the center of the pastry and place on a large baking sheet.\nBake for 20 minutes then reduce the heat to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C) and continue to bake for 30 to 35 minutes or until the pastry is golden.\nAllow the pie to cool for 10 minutes before unmolding, slicing, and serving with the reduced braising liquid as a gravy.\nEdit this page",

Set aside for 10 minutes to allow the mixture to macerate and the sugar to dissolve. Meanwhile, place a small plate in the freezer to chill; this will be used to test the doneness of the jam.\nPlace the saucepan over medium-high heat. (See Cook's Note for flavor additions.) Bring the mixture to a boil and then reduce the heat to medium low, stirring frequently. Continue to cook until the jam becomes thick and syrupy, about 1 1/2 hours. To test doneness, place a small amount of the jam onto the chilled plate and freeze for 2 minutes. Drag your finger or spoon through the jam. If the jam holds its shape and thickness, remove from the heat. If it's runny, continue to cook and test again in 5-minute increments. Once the jam has reached the right consistency, transfer to jars and cool completely before storing, covered tightly. Jam will keep in the refrigerator for up to 6 months. \n\nCook’s Note​\nTry these suggested additions for depth of flavor: 1) Add 1 teaspoon freshly cracked black pepper to the mixture before cooking. 2) Scrape the seeds and add the pod of 1 whole vanilla bean, split lengthwise, into the mixture before cooking (remove the pod before storing). Or use 2 teaspoons vanilla-bean paste. 3) Add 2 tablespoons balsamic vinegar to the mixture just before removing from the heat.Edit this page",

It was so cold and it tasted sooooo good! His communication of the process was not so hot!! ( The regular text is from Stu, while the italicized text are notes from me, to explain what I did!)\nIngredients:\nPotatoes, quite a lot! (I used red potatoes).\nCarrots (5-6 large, cut in small chunks). \n2 Tins of beans, use whatever kind you like (I made 1lb. dried northern beans, precooked in instapot with 6 cups of chicken broth, celery seed, 2 small bay leaves, garlic powder, onion powder, marjoram, and salt \u0026 pepper. Cook per instapot and add to other cooked ingredients with the cooking broth, but remove bay leaves).\n4 sticks of celery (chopped into small chunks).\nOnions,  i like lots of onions (I used 2 large onions, diced).\nBrown lentils (I used one 16 oz bag, cooked with the veggies, then veggie stock or chicken bone broth/stock and seasoning, cooked just enough to soften).\n1 tin of peas or frozen if you prefer (I used one bag of frozen).\n“You can add any other filling you wish.”\nWorcester sauce, quite a few dashes of this\nTomato ketchup, maybe 2 tablespoons\nliquid smoke, A couple of capfuls (or more).\na tablespoon of HP brown sauce (I used 3).\nA veg stock concentrate (I used 2 Tablespoons).\nsalt and pepper,\nGarlic,  Again i like a lot of garlic, at least a couple of segments. (I used 4 cloves).\nDried thyme, tarragon, marjoram, rosemary, parsley, and bay leaves x 2.\nBeef broth ~5-6 cups (I used veggie and chicken)\n1/2 cup butter\nMilk\n1 cup cheddar cheese\nGravy mix\nStu: “Yeah it’s a complex dish the way i do it lol.”\nFirst things first, get your potatoes on the boil and and also your lentils if you are using them.  Lentils are best boiling in veg or (chicken) stock.  Salt the potatoes of course but not the lentils.  You need quite a lot of potatoes.  Most times i never make enough and end up making more.\nIf you are using  meat you would prepare in the normal fashion by saute onions, then add meat till brown and then other veg and ingredients and saute till beginning to soft then add some veg stock and cook until veg is done.\nif you are using lentils you want to saute the onions first then add all the other veg and fresh garlic and let them all soften up together a bit in a large pot for a bit.\nThen add all the other ingredients and let them cook together for a few minutes before you add small amount of veg stock to cover and to boil till veg cooked.  Dont overcook as its all got to go in the oven.\nonce potatoes are ready you want to make your mash.  Im sure you know this but let them steam off before you mash.  Then add your butter and a splash of milk and mash mash mash. .\nOnce lentils are done you should not have hardly any liquid left in them as they should absorb it all.  You want drain off rest and let them sit.\n(Now i normally use Bisto, which again, i dont think you will get. So get a gravy mix of some kind and prepare that in separate pot.  Keep it nice and thick though).\nOnce everything is all ready mix everything together well in a large pot or bowl including lentils and gravy. season to taste at this point.\nYou are now ready to transfer to a large pyrex dish. Add  lentil Mix first then cover with  the delicious mashed potato and top with cheese.\nYou can now keep like this for days if you wish before you pop in the oven at 400 for around 30 to 40 minutes or until the cheese is nice and crispy on top.

Place the loin in the skillet and sear on all sides until evenly crusty and brown, about 3 minutes a side. Transfer to a cutting board and slice. Garnish with minced chives and serve with horseradish sauce.\n\n*Cook’s Note​\nTo butterfly the tenderloin: About 1 inch from the bottom of the roast, cut horizontally while opening and unfurling, just before you get to the edge. Then make a diagonal cut into the remaining thicker portion of the loin and open up to create a flat and stuff-able tenderloin.Edit this page",

Mix the remaining dulce de leche with the remaining 3/4 cup vanilla frosting; transfer to a piping bag fitted with a large round tip (this will be your lighter frosting).\nStarting in the center of the cake, pipe concentric circles of the darker frosting out to about a 2-inch circle. Using a small offset spatula, spread out the frosting to about a 3-inch circle.\nWith the lighter frosting, pipe concentric circles around the 3-inch circle, leaving about a 1-inch margin around the edge of the cake. Using a clean offset spatula, smooth the lighter frosting to the edge of the cake, so the entire top of the cake is covered. Smooth everything with a clean offset spatula.\nLine the point of a cake comb with the center of the cake and slowly rotate the cake to create concentric tree rings. When the lines of the circle meet, gently lift the comb (if you don't have a cake comb, this effect can be recreated using the tines of a fork).\nMake the chocolate bark: Line a baking sheet with a silicone baking mat and set aside.\nSeparately melt the dark and milk chocolates over a double boiler or in the microwave. Pour the dark chocolate over the prepared baking sheet, using an offset spatula to spread to the width of the baking sheet but not smoothing out the chocolate. Drizzle the melted milk chocolate on top. Using the edge of a small offset spatula or a butter knife, make vertical lines and swirls running through the chocolate to create the look of tree bark. Be sure to apply various levels of pressure as the offset spatula is pulled through the chocolate to create a textured look. Let cool at room temperature until firmly set, at least 30 minutes.\nBreak the chocolate into large vertical pieces of varying heights to form pieces of bark. Use these pieces to cover the sides of the cake.\nMake the berry mushrooms: Roll 1/2-inch pieces of marzipan between your fingers into stem shapes, making them wider at the base so they can stand upright. Place a stem inside the hollow of each raspberry and strawberry, using a skewer to secure the marzipan to the fruit if needed and to secure them down into the cake. Make mushrooms of various sizes and shapes to give a more natural effect and use the mushrooms to decorate the tops and sides of the cake, pressing gently to adhere the marzipan to the surface.\nMake the pistachio moss and marshmallow stones: Put the pistachios in a mini food processor and add approximately 8 drops each of the green and yellow food coloring. Pulse the food processor to chop the pistachios to a coarse grind the texture of moss. Adjust the food coloring as needed to achieve the desired color. Spoon the moss around the cake plate alongside the bottom of the cake.\nMix the mini marshmallows and cocoa in a small bowl. Rough up the marshmallows between your fingers to create texture, shaking off the excess cocoa powder. Add the stones to the base of the cake on the pistachio moss.\nUsing a fine-mesh strainer, shake confectioners' sugar over the top of the cake, creating a snowy effect.\nEdit this page",

Transfer the skillet to the oven and bake until the almonds are medium-brown, about 15 minutes.\nRemove from the oven, taste for flavor, add more spice mix or salt, if necessary. Return to the oven for another 5 minutes. Transfer the nuts to a sheet pan; they will crisp as they cool. Store the cooled almonds in an airtight container at room temperature.\nToasted Spice Rub:\nToast the fennel seeds, coriander seeds, and peppercorns in a small, heavy pan over medium heat. When the fennel turns light brown, work quickly. Turn on the exhaust fan, add the red pepper flakes, and toss, toss, toss, always under the fan. Immediately turn the spice mixture out onto a plate to cool. Put in a blender with the chili powder, salt, and cinnamon and blend until the spices are evenly ground. If you have a small spice mill or a coffee grinder dedicated to grinding spices, grind only the fennel, coriander, pepper, and chili flakes. Pour into a bowl and toss with the remaining ingredients.\nToasting freshens spices, releases their oils, and makes them more fragrant, as well as adding a new dimension of flavor. Keep the spice mix in a glass jar in a cool, dry place, or freeze.\nTaste your chili powder and, if too spicy and hot, cut back the amount. California chiles are almost sweet, not hot.       \n       \nNotes: Chop these nuts and add them to a turkey stuffing or a rice pilaf.Edit this page",

Mix in the melted butter until the crumbs are evenly moist and clump together slightly. Transfer the mixture to a 9-inch springform pan and press evenly onto the bottom and about 2 inches up the sides of the pan (to press, use plastic wrap or a flat-bottom measuring cup). Bake until the crust is fragrant and slightly darkened, 9 to 12 minutes. Let the pan cool on a rack. Lower the oven temperature to 300°F.\nFill and bake the cheesecake:\nIn a stand mixer fitted with the paddle attachment, beat the cream cheese, crème fraîche, flour, and a pinch of table salt on medium speed, scraping down the sides of the bowl and the paddle frequently, until very smooth and fluffy, about 5 minutes. Make sure the cheese has no lumps. Add the 1-1/4 cups granulated sugar and continue beating until well blended and smooth.\nAdd the crystallized ginger, fresh ginger, and vanilla, and beat until blended, about 30 seconds. Add the eggs one at a time, beating just until blended. (Don’t overbeat once the eggs have been added or the cheesecake will puff too much and crack as it cools.) Pour the filling into the cooled crust and smooth the top.\nBake at 300°F until the center jiggles like Jell-O when nudged, 55 to 65 minutes. The cake will be slightly puffed around the edges, and the center will still look moist. Set on a rack and cool completely. Cover and refrigerate until well chilled, at least 8 hours and up to 3 days. The cake can also be frozen at this point for up to 1 month (see make-ahead tip, below).\nUnclasp and remove the side of the springform pan and run a long, thin metal spatula under the bottom crust. Carefully slide the cake onto a flat serving plate. To cut, run a thin knife under hot water, wipe it dry, and cut the cake into slices, heating and wiping the knife after every slice.\n       \n       Edit this page",

        "Content": "Two Bean Salad with Basil VinaigretteTwo Bean Salad with Basil Vinaigrette\nSalads Main Meal Want to make Kim Acceptable Italian Inspired\nserves 2 as a meal, or 4 sides\n\nIngredients:\n1/2 pound (225 grams) regular green beans or skinnier haricots verts\nOne 15.5-ounce (440-gram) can large white beans, drained and rinsed\n1/2 medium fennel bulb, trimmed and thinly sliced (115 grams, or 1 cup)\n2 tablespoons (25 grams) drained capers\n1-1/2 cups (30 grams) fresh basil leaves\n1 teaspoon smooth Dijon mustard\n2 tablespoons (30 grams) red- or white-wine vinegar\n5 tablespoons (70 grams) olive oil\nKosher salt and freshly ground\nblack pepper\n1/2 cup (50 grams) Parmesan, chopped into mixed-sized rubble (optional)\nRight after your smiling faces—sorry, that was grimacingly twee—\na bowl of this salad is the thing I want to see most on a blanket at\na summer picnic. Why? It's a marinated salad that is excellent fresh or,\nlater, cold or at room temperature. Long beans, short beans, something\ncrunchy, an herb dressing—this is an oasis of summer freshness and tex-\nture. The cheese is optional, in case you wish to keep it dairy-free or just\nwant to home in on the fresher ingredients. The crunch is not, but there's\nsome flexibility here as to how you get to it. The star is the basil vinai-\ngrette, which is what happens when you crave pesto but want the acidity\nof a vinaigrette. It goes well on everything in the summer, so, if you have\nan overflowing basil plant about to flower, whack it down and make a\nbig jar of this dressing. Your tomatoes, grilled summer squash, and even\ngrain or lentil salads will thank you.\nIf you do not care for fennel, you can replace it here with 1 cup of\nthinly sliced celery. Oh, you don't like celery, either? Try half a white\nonion, thinly sliced. No raw onion, eh? You could add some thinly sliced\nradishes, because crunch is important here. But I think you are missing\nout on the fennel.\nTrim the green beans, and cut them into large segments. In salted water,\nboil the green beans for 2 minutes (1-1/2 minutes for haricots verts), until\ncrisp-tender, heavier on the crisp. Drain the beans, and plunge them into\nice water to cool them fully. Drain again, pat them dry on a towel, and\nplace them in a large bowl. Add the white beans, fennel, and capers.\nIn a food processor or blender, combine the basil, Dijon mustard, and vinegar until the herbs are well chopped. With the machine running, drizzle\nin 5 tablespoons olive oil in a thin stream. Season very well with salt and\nblack pepper; then add more vinegar and/or oil to taste. You might need\nto scrape the machine down a few times to get all of the leaves minced.\nPour the vinaigrette over the beans and turn to coat them in the bowl. Add\nthe cheese, if using. Taste, and adjust seasoning.Edit this page",

Once it is boiling, add the spinach and cook just for a minute, until it completely wilts. Drain and squeeze out as much water as possible with cheesecloth, a clean kitchen towel, or a wooden spoon. When cool enough to handle, coarsely chop and set aside.\nHeat the olive oil and butter in a large skillet over medium heat, add the leek and scallions and cook for 4 to 5 minutes, until softened. Add the garlic, stir, and cook for a minute, until fragrant. Raise the heat to medium high, wait a minute, and add the sliced mushrooms. Sprinkle in a teaspoon salt and black pepper, let them brown for a minute or two, and continue to cook until they let out their juices and begin to brown again, 4 to 5 minutes more. Once their juices have almost evaporated, add the chopped spinach, mix well, and continue cooking for another 4 to 5 minutes, until all the spinach juices evaporate. Turn off the heat, set aside, and let cool to room temperature.\nIn a small bowl, beat the eggs, add the requeson or ricotta cheese, the remaining teaspoon salt, and mix well. Combine with the spinach and mushroom mixture and set aside.\n\nTo make the zucchini, poblano and corn filling:​\n\nHeat 2 tablespoons of olive oil in a large nonstick skillet set over medium-high heat and season the zucchini slices with about ½ teaspoon salt and pepper to taste. Once the oil is hot, working in batches, brown the zucchini slices for a minute or so per side and transfer to a platter covered with paper towels. Set aside when you are done.\nReduce the heat to medium, add 2 more tablespoons of olive oil and the butter. Once the butter has melted, stir in the onions. Cook, stirring occasionally and scraping the bottom of the pan, for 7 to 8 minutes, until they have completely wilted and have browned around the edges. Add the poblano pepper strips and 1 teaspoon salt, stir, and continue to cook for another couple minutes. Make room in the middle of the pan, add the corn kernels and cook for a couple minutes, stirring to combine with the rest of the mix. Remove from the heat and taste for salt, adding more if need be. Set aside.\n\nTo make the salsa roja:​\n\nPlace the tomatoes, garlic and chiles in a medium saucepan, cover with water and bring to a boil over medium-high heat. Reduce heat to medium and simmer for about 10 minutes, until the tomatoes are cooked and mushy. Place the tomatoes, garlic and chiles into a blender, along with the onion and salt and process until completely smooth.\nHeat the oil in medium saucepan set over medium heat. Once the oil is hot, pour in the pureed tomato mixture, cover partially with a lid and simmer for 5 minutes, stirring here and there. Add the tomato paste and mix well. Pour in the chicken broth, stir, and cook for another 5 minutes, until well seasoned and thickened. Set aside.\n\nTo assemble the lasagna: ​\n\nGenerously butter a 9”x13” baking dish. Bring salted water to a boil in a large pot. Cook the lasagna noodles per package instructions, or for 8 to 9 minutes, stirring them as they cook so they won’t stick. Drain and immediately lay them out them on an oiled baking sheet.\nSet a rack in the middle of the oven and preheat to 375 degrees Fahrenheit.\nSpread about 1/2 cup tomato sauce onto the bottom of the buttered baking dish. Place a layer of cooked lasagna noodles over the sauce, draping them so they coat the entire surface. Spread half the spinach and mushroom filling over the noodles.\nPlace a second layer of cooked lasagna noodles. Top with half of the poblano and corn mixture and half of the zucchini slices. Cover with about a cup of the salsa roja.\nPlace a third layer of cooked lasagna noodles. Top with the other half of the spinach and mushroom filling.\nPlace a fourth layer of cooked lasagna noodles. Add the remaining half of the poblano and corn mixture, the rest of the zucchini slices, and about a cup of the salsa roja.\nPlace fifth layer of cooked lasagna noodles and cover with the remaining cup of tomato sauce. Add the grated Oaxaca or mozzarella cheese, and top with the Cotija cheese or parmesano reggiano.\nCover the baking dish loosely with aluminum foil, making sure it is tight all around the edges, but that there is a lot of space over the cheese - like a tent or bubble - so the aluminum is not very close to the cheese on top.\nPlace baking dish on a baking sheet and put into the oven. Bake for 40 minutes, then carefully remove the aluminum foil and return to the oven for another 25 to 30 minutes. The top should have melted, browned and begun to crisp along the edges. Remove from the oven and let the lasagna sit for 10 minutes before cutting into it.\nEdit this page",

Prepare the chicken strips: On a work surface, place chicken between two pieces of plastic wrap or wax paper. Using smooth side of a meat mallet, flatten to an even 1/2-inch thickness. Cut into 1/2-by-3-inch strips.\nStep 1\nPlace walnuts, flour, salt, cinnamon, and pepper in the bowl of a food processor fitted with the metal blade. Process until finely chopped and well combined; transfer to a shallow bowl. Pour cream into another shallow bowl.\nStep 2\nDip chicken strips in cream with one hand, letting excess drip off; using your other hand, dredge in flour mixture, turning to coat both sides, and tapping off excess. Place on a baking sheet.\nStep 3\nHeat 2 tablespoons vegetable oil in a large skillet over medium-high heat. Working in batches, add chicken strips; cook, turning occasionally, until golden brown all over, about 3 minutes. Transfer to a wire rack set over a baking sheet. Wipe skillet with paper towels, and repeat with remaining chicken, adding 2 tablespoons oil with each batch.**\nStep 4\nTransfer baking sheet with chicken to the oven, and bake until chicken is cooked through, about 10 minutes more.\nStep 5\nMeanwhile, make the sauce: Melt butter in a clean skillet over medium heat. Add shallots and walnuts, and cook until shallots are tender and nuts are golden, about 2 minutes. Add wine; cook until most of the liquid has evaporated. Add 1 1/4 cups chicken stock, and pomegranate juice and molasses. Raise heat to medium-high; cook until liquid is reduced by half, about 10 minutes.\nStep 6\nIn a small bowl, whisk together the remaining 1/4 cup chicken stock and flour until well combined. Stir into sauce, and simmer until thickened, about 1 minute more. Stir in pomegranate seeds, and season with salt and pepper. Serve hot with chicken strips.\nStep 7\n\n**Cook's Notes:\nIf you like, thread chicken strips on bamboo skewers at the end of step four, before baking; soak skewers in water before using to prevent scorching.Edit this page",

Combine with the granulated sugar, salt, onion powder, granulated garlic, cayenne, black pepper, mustard, chili powder, cumin and paprika in a bowl and hand stir until well incorporated. Store in an airtight container.\nFor the BBQ mother sauce: In a medium saucepan, heat the oil over medium heat. Add the onion and saute until translucent, about 5 minutes. Turn the heat to low if the onion is cooking too fast--you don't want it caramelized or browned. As the onion is getting close, add the garlic and cook until lightly golden, about 2 minutes longer. Add the ketchup, honey, tomato paste, vinegar, brown sugar, Worcestershire, dry mustard, cayenne and black pepper and stir well. Slowly add up to 1/2 cup water until the sauce reaches the consistency you like. A slightly thick consistency is best. Add about 3 tablespoons of the basic BBQ rub, stir well and taste. The sauce should have a good, well-rounded flavor. Add more of the basic BBQ rub in 1-tablespoon increments until your desired flavor is achieved, up to about 1/2 cup total. Cool and store in an airtight container in the refrigerator for up to 10 days.\nFor the ribs: Rinse the ribs and remove the membrane from the back. Trim any excess fat from the tops of the slabs. Trim 1 bone from the large end of the ribs and 2 bones from the small end. This will give you a much more consistent slab for cooking.\nStarting on the backs, sprinkle the slabs of ribs with approximately 1/2 tablespoon of the basic BBQ rub each, then add 1/2 tablespoon yellow mustard each and massage into the meat. Flip the ribs over and repeat. Wrap tightly with plastic wrap and refrigerate for at least 8 hours. For a contest, I marinate ribs like this for 12 to 16 hours.\nPrepare a smoker to run at 225 degrees F with around 4 chunks of apple wood and 4 chunks of cherry wood so that the wood will smolder throughout the cooking. Remove the ribs from the refrigerator, unwrap and repeat the basic BBQ rub and mustard procedure, massaging them in. Don't get it too thick or paste-like, as this will give you a dark appearance when cooked. Place the ribs in the smoker meat-side up and cook for 2 hours. Remove the ribs from the smoker and increase the temperature to 250 degrees F. Apply the basic BBQ rub and mustard to both sides of the ribs as before. On the top sides, slather approximately 1 tablespoon of honey over the surface of each slab, then sprinkle heavily with the turbinado sugar. Lay each slab of ribs meat-side up on a piece of heavy-duty aluminum foil and fold up the edges. Pour approximately 1 to 2 ounces of the grape juice into the bottom of each foil package, then finish wrapping the ribs but don't crimp the edges--you want steam to be able to escape.\nReturn the ribs to the cooker for 2 hours, then test for tenderness. (I cook ribs in this stage until they look overdone and too tender. Don't worry, they'll tighten up. If they still have too much texture, leave them in for 20 to 30 more minutes.) Remove the ribs from the cooker, open the foil and drain off the liquid. Using the foil as a tool, \"roll\" the ribs over so the bone side is up, glaze with the BBQ mother sauce, then roll them back over and glaze the tops. Using long tongs, carefully remove the ribs from the foil and place them back in the smoker for 15 minutes. This will let the glaze cook onto the ribs and let the ribs tighten back up. Remove from the cooker and allow to rest for 5 minutes, apply a very thin coat of sauce to \"glisten\" the ribs, then lightly sprinkle with chipotle powder before serving.\nEdit this page",

Stir in zucchini shreds. In a smaller bowl, whisk together flour, salt, baking soda, cinnamon and nutmeg. Stir dry ingredients into zucchini batter, mixing until just combined.\nHeat a large, heavy skillet (my favorite for pancakes is a cast-iron) over medium heat. Once hot, melt a pat of butter in pan and swirl it around until it sizzles. Scoop scant 1/4-cup dollops of batter (mine were about 3 tablespoons each) in pan so the puddles do not touch. Cook until bubbles appear on the surface, about 2 to 3 minutes.\nFlip pancakes and cook another minute or two, until golden underneath.\nTransfer pancakes to prepared pan to keep warm as well as ensure that they’re all cooked through when they’re served. Repeat with remaining batter. Serve warm. Repeat next weekend.Edit this page",

(If you prefer thicker zucchini with more bite, slice to 1/8-inch thickness.) Thinly slice 1 medium yellow or white onion until you have 1 1/2 cups. Place the onion and zucchini in a large bowl. Add 1 tablespoon plus 3/4 teaspoon kosher salt and toss to evenly coat. Cover the bowl and refrigerate for 2 hours to allow the zucchini and onion to dry out.\nDrain the vegetables and pat dry with paper towels. Pack into a clean 1-quart jar or 2 pint-size jars.\nCoarsely chop 1/2 bunch fresh dill until you have 1/4 cup. Place the dill, 1 tablespoon yellow mustard seeds, and 1/2 to 1 1/2 teaspoons red pepper flakes if desired on top of the vegetables, dividing them between the two jars if needed.\nBring 1 cup distilled white vinegar, 1/2 cup water, and 1/4 cup granulated sugar to a boil over high heat in a small saucepan. Boil until the sugar is dissolved. Pour into the jar(s), leaving 1/2-inch space on top. Use a metal straw, chopstick, or thin utensil to push the veggies around to release any big air pockets and make sure they are submerged in the brine. Carefully cover with lids and let cool at room temperature for 1 hour. Serve immediately or refrigerate and enjoy for up to 1 week.\n\nRECIPE NOTES​\n**Safe pickling: ***Safe storaging of any pickled products require use of vinegar that has at least 5 % acidity. Many vinegars are only 4%, so check the vinegar you are using!\nStoring: Pickled zucchini can be refrigerated in the jar(s) for up to 1 week.Edit this page",
