## Instructions
 
1. Whisk buttermilk, egg, and canned pumpkin.
2. In a bowl, combine the flour, the sugar, the baking powder, the baking soda, pumpkin pie spice and the salt.
3. Pour the flour mixture into the pumpkin mixture whisk until lumps are gone. At this point, you can see whether you need more liquid or more flour.
4. Mix in the cup of chopped apple.
5. Heat a large skillet over medium heat or a griddle set to 360 degrees, and coat with cooking spray. Pour ¼ cup of batter onto the skillet or griddle, and cook until bubbles begin to appear on the surface.

Remove from griddle/skillet and serve. Top with whipped cream and some pumpkin pie spice or syrup.
