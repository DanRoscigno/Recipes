### **INSTRUCTIONS:**

1. Preheat the oven to 425 degrees F. Grease an oven-safe skillet with olive oil.

2. Season the chicken with salt and pepper. Spread each cutlet with 1 tsp fig preserves, then wrap 2 pieces of prosciutto around each cutlet. Transfer the chicken to the prepared skillet. Arrange the shallots, peaches, and thyme around the chicken. Drizzle olive oil over the peaches, season with salt and pepper. Transfer to the oven and roast for 15-20 minutes, until the chicken is cooked.

3. Switch the oven to broil Remove the peaches from the skillet to a plate. Return the chicken to the oven and broil for 1-2 minutes, until the prosciutto is crisp. **WATCH CLOSELY.** Remove from the oven, place the chicken on the plate with the peaches.

4. Place the skillet with the shallots and garlic over medium heat. Add the butter and a pinch of red pepper flakes. Add the balsamic vinegar and wine. Bring to a boil over high heat. Boil 3-5 minutes, until reduced by half. Slide the chicken and peaches back into the skillet, simmer 1 minute. Remove from the heat.
