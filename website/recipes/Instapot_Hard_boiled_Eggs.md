# Instapot Hard boiled Eggs

`Quick`

You simply place the eggs on the steamer rack in the pot, add a cup of water, close the lid, and set to cook on low pressure for six minutes. You then immediately release pressure and chill the eggs in an ice bath for five to 20 minutes (I went for 15) before peeling.

**Total Time:** 32 minutes
